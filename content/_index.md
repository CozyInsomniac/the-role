## Plot
### Overview
The Role's plot follows several intertwining plot lines and sub-plot lines. Edrick and NecroNyx are considered to be the main antagonists of the overall plot.
### Summary
- **Act 1: First Meeting** -Samuel pokes his head out of his bunker just in time to see Sunflight fall from the sky, cursing in German. The two soon meet and greet one another, before fighting a large portion of the Nazi army. Sunflight agrees to stay with Samuel for a short bit, and the two become acquaintances.Samuel accidentally blows up a nuclear bomb in the wasteland, so he and Sunflight lay low in the bunker for a few days. Later,Samuel finds a portal surrounded in barbed wire, and tells Sunflight about it. The two go through, and find themselves *(either in a Shipping Dock where they meet Malory, or a mountainside military hideout, where Sunflight is captured?)*

- Several events in the Role have been retconned:
	- **Horny Jail** - This event entailed Samuel and Sunflight being trapped inside a prison housing several horny men as prisoners.

	- **V-Samuel Rape** - Numerous times, both in dreams and reality, V-Samuel sexually harassed and raped Sunflight, even impregnating her at one point. Sunflight later aborted the child.
	- **Skyfall and Apollo** - Several times, Apollo sexually harassed and raped Skyfall.
	- **(Uncertain) Older Samuel and Sunflight's Child** - An older version of Samuel and Sunflight had a child. This was retconned due to SB later specifying the differences between humans and Pyrrhians.
	- **Madeline's Origins** - Madeline was originally raised by a manipulative mother who taught her how to falsely accuse and incriminate men for sexual acts against her. After failing to do so against Samuel, Madeline's mother reconsidered her ways, and raised Madeline in a less manipulative way
	- **Ambrosia** - This was one of Sam's characters. SB does not remember making this character.
