Sammy sighs as he eyes Sata. The synth is back in "human" form, but is still an eyesore. His "clothes" consist of hastily made plate armor fashioned with materials from his dragon form. His head is uncovered, his eyes the same as before, and hair all but gone. A patched, but still visible crack runs vertically down his face.
"I guess that'll do for new." Sammy remarks. "What about the rest of the material? What'd you do with it?"
Sata rapidly starts signing with his hands.
"Woah, woah- stop!" Sammy Interrupts. "What's all that for? Just speak!"
"Apologies." Sammy cringes at the distorted Sunflight voice. "Sunflight found my past voice jarring."
"Oh... right. Well, I don't speak sign language, at least not in this form. You can talk around Sun and I, but just keep quiet around anyone else. Got it?"
Sata gives a jerky nod.
"Great." Sammy turns to Sun. "You wanna take him with us? We can tell Cirrus that he's a friendly scavenger or something."

Sata’s human form was at least something she found recognize. Even if it is still unnerving. Swallowing that, she sighs. 
“My dad isn’t an idiot, he’ll know something is up with Sata, especially with his movement. I’m still scared of how he’ll react to your human form let alone the state Sata is in. I know we can’t hide him forever, or leave him somewhere. I don’t want to overwhelm my dad, and I don’t want him to lose our trust.” This had been gnawing at her for a while, the anxiety of not knowing and the damn near paralyzing fear that came with it. It was easy to brush aside while Sammy in his dragon form, but now that Sata was here, she’s torn. She knows full well her father’s views on the humans of Pyrrhia. The scar on his shoulder is an ever present reminder. Showing him Sata might break him. But they can’t hide him forever. Ripping off the bandaid now while they could explain things might work, but the fear of disapproval and being shunned weighed heavy in her mind. She’s stopped trying to hide her mind. Guilt seeped in, as Sammy had to be reading all of this. It isn’t his fault or problem to fix.
“I don’t know how to tell him. I can punch a king in the face yet I can find it in myself to tell my own father what I’ve been doing all this time. He has a right to know but I’m terrified of how he will react to this news. It’d be rude of me to get you to tell him.”

Sammy's gaze shifts between Sunflight and Sata. Mentation is written across his face, blanketed in silence. "I'll have Sata patch himself up - for real, this time." He finally says. "He'll keep himself hidden for... long enough, and whenever he and Cirrus cross paths, it should go smoother. As for my human form, I still have no clue how to shift to it, so we don't have to worry about that. Truth be told I'd rather show Cirrus myself first and Sata some other time. You know how Sata can be."
Sunflight is quiet, considering Sammy's words.
"How long would it take for Sata to fix himself?"
Sammy turns to Sata. 
"Well?"
"Approximately two days." Sata scratches out.
"And can you keep yourself hidden for that long?"
"Most likely."
Sammy faces Sunflight.
"Sounds like a plan. Sound good, Sun?"
"What about leaving Sata alone?"
"He's been... staying alive so far. He'll be fine."
"And if my dad finds Sata before he's done fixing himself?"
"...We'll cross that bridge when- if we get there."

Sunflight takes a deep breath, nodding. 
“Okay. We’ll tell him in the morning. Hiding it any longer won’t end well if he either finds out or a curious dragon finds Sata first.” She turns to Sata, “Avoid any dragons in the area other than us, and any local humans. We’ll come find you when you are fixed.”
Getting some rest was a good idea. It would be a busy day, and they had a long conversation ahead with her dad. 
“I’ll think of how to tell him on the way back. You shouldn’t have to be the one to do it.” Sunflight starts to walk back towards their camp, dimly lit by glowing embers of their fire. Why is she so intimidated by this? Why does the thought of telling her own father the truth about her life scare her more than going into a fight?
