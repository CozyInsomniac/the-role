# Trivia
- Sunflight hates the thought of having to fly or be in a plane with a burning passion. And the thought of being stuck in a metal tube 30,000 feet in the air can give her nightmares.
- Sunflight can be rather jealous over/possessive of Sammy when other women try flirting with him. She knows he wonâ€™t cheat on her it is just an irrational feeling she gets.
- Sunflight  hated living in the bunker at first, as it reminded her too much of being trapped in an underground cave with no easy way out. She learned to like it and now considers it home. Having someone to talk to and working lights definitely helped, as did the renovations she and Sammy did to make it more livable.
- Whenever Sunflight takes a nap in the bunker, it's equally likely that she'll wake up with either Sammy or Madeline cuddling her.
