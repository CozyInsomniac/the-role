| 1            | The Authors' House | The "top" layer. Contains the Authors' house and the Authors. Characters from here are called "**Authors**".<br>The Space here is called **The Authors' House**.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2            | The Pantheon       | Contains all divine, demonic, and spiritual Entities and Realities. Characters from here are called "**Divines**".<br>Spaces from here are called **Eternities**                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3            | The Multiverse     | Contains all non-spiritual Realities and Entities.<br>Characters from here are called "**Entities**".<br>Spaces from here are called "**Realities**".                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 4            | The Dreamverse     | Contains all dreams experienced by Characters and Divines and Entities native to those dreams (Ex. Vampires from that one dream Sun had). The Dreamverse has no physical effect on higher layers, unless specified by Authors (Ex. The Dragon Dream).<br>Characters from here are called "**Visions**".<br>Spaces from here are called **Dreams**. |
| 5            | The Void           | The Void is an infinite expanse of nothing which contains all retconned Characters, Spaces, and Events. Characters, spaces, and Events can only be brought into The Void by the Authors, and, once brought into The Void, are erased from past, present, and future of their respective timelines.                                                 |
A Character from any layer may be referred to as a "**Character**".
A Space from any layer may be referred to as a **Space**. A **Space** is any specific universe, dimension, world, or location that has been specified to exist in a specific layer.
A happening or action from any layer may be referred to as an **Event**

| 0           | Authors are not subject to any form of rule (succeeding this one), limitation, or restriction. Authors are absolutely omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent in ability. These properties are supreme and absolute. They have never been, are not, and can never be, superseded, negated, modified, ignored, copied, stolen, matched, imitate, or erased by any Character's power(s), including opposing omnipotence. Beings cannot turn themselves into Authors, and Authors cannot be affected in any way, shape, or form, by an Character's power(s), including other Authors. |
| 1           | Character from Layer 2 and below are broadly known as "Entities". Universes, dimensions, worlds, and locations from Layer 2 and below are broadly known as "Realities"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2           | Characters may travel between their native and lower layers, with the exception of the Void. Characters may not travel to layers higher than their native later unless given permission / brought into said higher layer by a Character from that higher layer. Characters may only travel to the void if brought in by an author.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3           | Characters have partial or full power / control over lower layer Characters. Lower layer Characters can fight back against higher layer Character' power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 4           | Spaces and Characters do not exist until implicitly or explicitly brought into The Role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
