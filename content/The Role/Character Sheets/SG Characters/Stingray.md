## Appearance(s)

### Human Form

- In human form, Stingray stands at an an above-average 5ft 11in (1.8m). He has tan skin, neck-length, ashy blonde hair, and striking eyes, with light blue outer outer irises, dark yellow inner irises, and draconic pupils. His ears are slightly pointed, and his teeth - especially canines - are much sharper than the average human. Stingray is fairly lean, but still sports a strong, well-muscled build. His arms and legs are noticeably toned, due to his extensive time spent swimming, and his fingers and toes are webbed. Aside from his head, Stingray does not have any other body hair. In human form, Stingray is normally seen sporting t-shirts, spanning a wide variety of colors and styles, paired with Khaki shorts and a pair of sandals. Occasionally, Stingray will wear sunglasses, though he often loses them when swimming.

### Half Form

- In half form, Stingray retains most of his human-form features, but also gains a pair of two horns, a pair of four wings, and a tail. Stingray's horns protrude towards the back of his head. They are about 5 inches long, have a black-to-light-blue gradient, running from base to tip. His wings are reminiscent of a hivewing's in shape and style. However, they sport scales with light-blue and turquoise coloration, as well as a hexagonal pattern in their webbing. Each hexagon in Stingray's wings is capable of glowing, Stingray's tail is about 4 feet long, with black, webbed spines, and a mix of turquoise, black, and yellow scales running along its top side, and light beige scales on the underside. The end of Stingray's tail has a retractable black barbed stinger, laced with extremely potent venom. Similar, smaller stingers exist in each of Stingray's wrists. In this form, Stingray's fingernails are slightly longer, as well as much harder and sharper. Normally, Stingray wears only shoes and pants in this form.

***
- **Background / Backstory:** After a seawing got a little too adventurous, he found himself on the shores of Pantala. A few days later, the seawing had met and got together with a native hivewing. The two eventually had Stingray, but, in fear of what the hivewing queen would think, raised him in secret. Eventually, when Stingray was older, he, after hearing many stories about Pyrrhia from his father, finally decided to visit the continent. Within 24 hours of arriving, Stingray accidentally pissed off an animus dragon who enchanted him to become "a weaker version of himself", then banished him to another world. However, because Stingray fought back during the spell's casting, the enchantment was botched, and Stingray was sent to the human world in human form, though with the ability to shift between human, half, and dragon forms. While Stingray doesn't hold what the animus dragon did against it, he doesn't care for animus dragons. He is in no rush to get back to Pyrrhia / Pantala, and enjoys his time in the human form. Nowadays, he lives in Puerto Rico.
