## Appearance(s)

- Years of wasteland life, as well as a myriad of Biological Modifications (BioMods) have turned Sammy into a fairly intimidating person. He stands with a calm confidence, his back and neck held upright, yet shoulders kept relaxed. He has a head of short, messily combed black hair, and a pair of piercing dark brown eyes. Thanks to bio mods, Sammy has a well-toned body, devoid of any body hair. His skin is tinted a light brown, and his hands and arms are littered with faded scars, earned from countless hours working on his inventions. Sammy typically wears turtlenecks and jeans, sometimes adorned with a dark brown trench coat. Out in the wasteland, Sammy dawns a special pair of titanium-framed boots, as well as his beloved set of foldable, and nearly impenetrable armor: The Shell.

- **Background / Backstory:** Samuel "Sammy" Hawkins was born on March 16, 2002, five years after his brother, Troy. Both brothers showed a knack for engineering from a young age, with Sammy getting heavily into computer hardware and software with a side of chemistry, and Troy being a pioneer in architecture and mechanical engineering. 2007 was the beginning of the world's second Cold War, pitting the world's superpowers against one another once again with razor-sharp tension. Under the threat of nuclear destruction, a similar paranoia that plagued the first cold war, the brothers' family purchased a "home under home" - a government-made nuclear bomb shelter, built right under their house. Construction of the bunker began mid 2008, and finished at the end of the year. Back then, the bunker was small - about 200 square feet in total. It consisted of a single living room with a small bathroom section on the side.

Through the duration of 2009-2015, Cold War 2 tensions rose, and many times Sammy would find him and his family cowering in the bunker, waiting for the bombs to drop. The bombs never came. It was also during this time that Sammy decided to heavily pursue his passion for computers. In late 2019, Sammy found himself taking an interest into computers. He taught himself a wealth of knowledge about various computer topics, and eventually tried applying for internships at various tech companies. Since he was only fifteen at the time, all of the companies rejected his applications, save for one: Phantom Technologies - PhanTech for short. This internship eventually lead to Sammy discovering that the CEO of PhanTech, Edrick Phronox, planned to end the world on December 25, 2020.  

Immediately, Sammy realized that he knew too much. After using some stolen PhanTech technologies to buff his own knowledge about various sciences and skills, he, up until the day of reckoning, the boy took to modifying and expanding his family's bunker, adding rooms for different workshops, living quarters, a generator, and more. At the same time, he took to downloading as much useful and sentimental information from the internet that he could, grabbing eBooks, music, documents, videos, and more, and storing them on his PhanTech-provided laptop, which the company had built with 500 petabytes of storage. Ironically, during this time, Cold War tensions drastically fell, seemingly making his family's investment in a bunker go to waste. In the final 48 hours before Armageddon, Sammy, with the help of his brother, whom he had convinced of the oncoming apocalypse, moved as much as he could from his house into the bunker. His parents, whom he'd desperately tried to convince of the apocalypse, had not heeded his word, and had gone out on an anniversary date. Two minutes before the bombs dropped, Sammy and Troy sealed their bunker, and waited.

The house was all but completely leveled from the blasts. Sammy and Troy remained safe in their bunker, though the knowledge of everything they had ever known being, well, gone, was practically worse than death. The brothers never left the bunker - not for a year, that is. They had one another to keep themselves company, and to keep from going insane.

About one year after the bombs dropped, Sammy and Troy went out into the resulting wasteland to explore. As they expected, the house was gone, as was the entire neighborhood. Practically everything within a 2 mile radius had been wiped out, most likely including the rest of the earth. The two brothers explored the wasteland for five hours, finding nothing of real use. On their way back, however, they encountered their first synth. Sammy barely escaped with his life, however Troy wasn't so lucky.

For the next month or so, Sammy stayed holed up in the bunker, suffering bad depression, and absolutely terrified of every going outside again. Eventually, after suffering severe cabin fever and nearly losing his mind, he forced himself to return to the surface. Past depression soon turned to anger, and he soon found himself working tirelessly to renovate and fortify his bunker for wasteland combat. Using his stolen PhanTech knowledge, he built a multitude of weapons and armor, notably his MG-42, "The Shell" armor, and brain chip. Months went by as he spent nearly every waking moment gearing up for the wasteland. Finally, he went out.

It took a while for Sammy to adjust to the wasteland, but eventually, he did. He had finally accepted his bunker as his new home, and had all but fully adjusted to the world outside. Dealing with synths, deathclaws, and other wasteland creatures had become almost normal for him, and he had discovered, but never made contact with, other societies outside of the wasteland.
Towards mid-2024, Sammy finally mustered up the courage to raid Phantech's underground synth factories. Ever since he had used their "backup" brain book, he had known of its existence and exact location, but he never went out of fear. Sammy's raid went almost as poorly as it could have, setting off alarms left and right, and almost resulting in his death multiple times. In the end, however, Sammy was successful in stealing a synth labeled "EA-0". After barely making it out of the factory alive and escaping back to his bunker, Sammy got to work on examining and modifying the synth to be his own. On the first day of 2025, Sammy finally finished the modification, complete with tests in virtual simulations, and a 90% certainty that his code would work. Luckily for him, it did, leaving him with a new, synthetic best friend and guardian.
