Today I fell in love.

It’s not a philia, nor a pragma, storge, or anything like that. I fully admit that this is an obsession. I’ll do anything - literally **anything** \- to keep them. If I have to loose an arm, I’ll loose it for them. If I have to kill, I’ll kill for them. If I have burn a city down, I’ll burn it for them. And if I have to die, they’re coming with me. They don’t have a choice.

I haven’t felt butterflies in my stomach like this in years.

My hands are shaking. I can **see** them shaking.

God, it’s so beautiful.

I’m smiling. I’m actually smiling!

I have to play with them. **Now**

Jesus, what the hell did I write? Sorry to any future Samuels who had to read that. Let me try to explain what all that nonsense was about. Long story short, my brain chip experiment was a success. It’s exactly what it sounds like; stick a computer chip in your brain, and bam, profit. Of course, that first part’s a lot easier said than done. I nearly killed myself trying to actually plant the chip in my brain in the first place. It sounds crazy (and honestly kind of is), but I took a sample of the rabies virus, and modified it to be less, well, deadly, and a lot more useful. In this case, “useful” meant the virus jump-started the several month process of biologically growing a computer chip in my brain. Looking at it written in front of my face now, it still seems ridiculous. But hey, it worked. …I think I’m avoiding the elephant in the room here. Okay, so all that talk of “love” and “obsession” was just me getting ~~way too~~ really excited about all the new stuff my brain chip could do. For starters, I’m seeing the world in a whole new way. I can pick something up, and know exactly how heavy it is, its temperature, it radioactivity, and a whole bunch of other stuff. I can drop a box of ammo on the floor any count exactly how many rounds fell out of it. I can glance at a math equation and know the answer before I’ve even processed the first number. I can see my hands shaking. Like, the microscopic movements and stuff. At least, they’re microscopic movements *now.* Long story short, I can pretty much do all the wacky-tacky cyberpunk stuff I’ve always imagined being possible in some dystopian future. Needless to say, I was very, ahem, excited about all this stuff. Maybe I should add an emotional control unit to the chip. Just in case.
