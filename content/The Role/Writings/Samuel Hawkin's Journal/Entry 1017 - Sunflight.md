**I KNEW IT!**

I knew it. I absolutely *knew* it. Portals are **real**.
I saw one today with my own eyes. The memory's still fresh in my head. There I was, standing just outside my bunker, MG-42 in hand, ready for my latest expedition: Find Sata.

As opposed to his two-day-at-most scavenging trips, it had been about week since I last saw him.

You can imagine my concern; I didn't want to lose him too.

Turns out the world had other plans for me. At least they were less apocalyptic this time.
Just as I was ready to set off, this weird, glowing "hole" opened up in the sky. Next thing I know, this girl comes flying out from the hole, cursing in German like a sailor. She landed not too far away from me, and seemed pretty banged up, so I decided to take a risk.

I talked to her.

"Hello." I greeted. Her head snapped towards me, eyes wide as her hand shot down to an odd grey canister on her hip - I assumed a gun. My hands tensed on my MG. I didn't wanna shoot this girl three seconds into meeting her, but if she tried anything funny, it was lights out for her.
By the look on her face, she thought the same about me.

"Hello." She responded carefully, hand still glued to the canister.

Oh nice, she spoke English... and didn't try to shoot me. Also nice.

Aaaand, good things never last forever.

I know it sounds crazy, and I'm honestly having a hard time believing it myself, but I swear this is what happened next:

First another portal opens, then, out pours a whole battalion of Nazis.
No, I'm not joking. **Nazis**. Like, straight up World War 2, swastika-wearing, "Hail Hitler" Nazis.

Then this girl - this German and English speaking girl who just came out of a freaking **portal in the sky** \- turns into a *dragon*.

Yes, this is cartoonish, yes, this is the type of thing you see in a poorly written fantasy novel, and no, this wasn't the weirdest thing I've ever seen.

...Ok, yes it was, but I've seen some **things**, alright?

I'm getting off track. Well, I've *been* off track. I started off talking about portals, and now I'm writing about this nonsense, but screw it. It's *my* journal. I can do whatever I want with it.

Not like anyone's gonna read it.

Anyways, long story short, girl comes out of a portal, Nazis come out of another one, girl turns into a *dragon* and starts fighting the Nazis, I decide "well dang, I guess this is happening now", whip out my armor and switch my MG to full auto, and before you know it, the girl and I are mowing down Nazis like we're playing Wolfenstein on steroids.

We ended up winning, somehow. The land outside my bunker looked even *more* like a wasteland, I had used up three and a half mags of ammo (250 rounds per mag, mind you), and the dragon girl... looked pretty terrible. She landed next to me and "shifted" back to human form. Scars, bruises, blood, and all sorts of other crap littered her body. Though, props to her, she was still alive. I used up one of my medi-pens to heal her, which it did quite perfectly, might I add, and she seemed especially ungrateful for it. Those things are hard to make, you know.

That aside, after that big fight, we *properly* introduced ourselves. The girl told me her name was "Sunflight". I thought the name a bit odd, but it was fitting for her.

Oh, that reminds me! I haven't even described what she looks like! Here we go:
Sunflight was about 5 foot 10 inches. She had pale skin, bright red hair that reached down just past her shoulders, and amber-colored eyes with slit pupils. Her ears were pointed at the tips; they reminded me of an elf. She wore black combat boots, brown jeans held up with a dark red belt, a bright red t-shirt, and what looked like a heavily patched up bomber jacket. She also had on an arm guard and a necklace, though the latter I only caught glimpse of. If you stuffed the soul of a fire dragon into the human body, you'd pretty much get Sunflight.

She's pretty.

I hope we get along.
