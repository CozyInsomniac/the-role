I never thought such a big waste of time would be so worth it.
Last month, I started the project: a scale model of Troy and I's old house. It honestly wasn't meant to be all that special. If anything, it was nothing more than a clever, but useless, distraction. Little did I know, what would become of it would be irreplaceable. It started as a piece of cardboard and some popsicle sticks. 25 days later, it ended as a detailed scale model of Troy and I's house. It's not perfect, but hey, it's the best we could do. Even so, the model itself was far from the most valuable part of the project. Working on it actually got Troy and I talking to each other again. Hell, I even saw him smile once!
I'll admit, I started these journals off pretty depressingly, but I think things are starting to look up. Troy and I are still trapped here in this prison cell of a bunker, but we're alive and well. The way the world is now, that's all that matters. Tomorrow, I think I'll try and build a model castle with Troy. I've always wanted to design booby traps!
