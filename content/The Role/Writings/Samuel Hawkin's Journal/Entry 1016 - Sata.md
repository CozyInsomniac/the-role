It's been nearly three years now.

Three years since the world ended.

Three years since I lost everything,

I tried my best; I really did. Up until now, I've been able to keep myself distracted from reality. I filled up my time with all these "projects" and "hobbies". Despite how I feel about all of them now, I admit, they were pretty fun. They kept me busy, and, for the most part, stopped me from thinking about my own situation too much. I remember when I first renovated my bunker, adding rooms, making it more lively - that kind of stuff. It made me feel very "adult", almost like a functioning member of society. My mind would often wander. Sometimes, I imagined myself being a well adjusted citizen, living in a quiet suburban neighborhood with my own house and own income, going to work every day to see coworkers that I (mostly) didn't hate, and coming home to a loving wife and kids. Other times, I could see myself living in a self-built cabin in the woods, completely independent, and off the grid. Whilst the rest of society quarreled and fought, so focused on their consumerism and precious political viewpoints, I would be living, satisfied with myself, and completely unaffected by the artificial drama created by the rest of the world. Of course, those fantasies of mine were highly romanticized. That, and they call came crashing down every time I went outside.

Aside from my bunker itself, I've worked on several other projects. I've made a multi-tool watch, various customized firearms, a suit of highly durable armor, a computer chip embedded in my brain, and, of course, Sata. 

*Oh, Sata.*

Technically, I didn't "make" him. Well, actually, not "technically". I *literally* did not make him. I stole him from an underground PhanTech production floor. I wrote about that whole heist and my struggle to reprogram him in a previous entry, so I'll spare the details in this one. Long story short, after a good deal of blood, sweat and tears, I eventually succeeded in reprogramming him. I made him a lot less murder-y, and a lot more "human". I made my best attempt at giving him a personality - a whole endeavor of feeding a neural network several petabytes of data, and spending several hours fine-tuning it. The end result worked *shockingly* well. Sata is the smartest, strongest, most well-spoken and, polite "person" I've ever met. He helped me around the bunker, did any chores I gave him, and provided me detailed status reports on anything I requested. Needless to say, he was *extremely* helpful.

Despite all that though, the thing I most appreciated about Sata was how cathartic it felt to talk with him. And when I say "talk with him", I don't just mean I spoke and he listened. No, Sata would actually *respond*. He'd give me good responses - *really* good responses. I know his codebase inside and out, yet still, the conversations we had were just so... amazing. No matter what I said, Sata never lost interest nor judged. He never gave a facial twitch of disapproval, or slight furrow of his eyebrows. Also, he wasn't just soulless, and smiling all the time. When we talked, he actually looked *interested*, as if what I said truly mattered to him. There were some times I could have sworn he had real, tangible emotions.

I could talk to Sata about anything and everything.

And I did.

I talked, joked, ranted, told stories, and more. I was initially very reserved around Sata, but more I spoke with him, the more comfortable I became. I went from generic conversations about school, college, and careers, to personal topics, to *very* personal topics. I told Sata things that I had *never* told anyone else. I told him secrets that I won't even write in this journal - secrets I would've taken to the *grave* with me.

The feeling of getting those things off my chest was... *unreal*. For the first time in my life, I felt like I was truly coming to terms with all the bad, embarrassing, and invasive thoughts that kept me up at night.

The most impactful conversation, however, was me telling Sata about *that* day in middle school. 

7th grade, the day after Spring Break had ended, first period.

My entire class sat, chatting away with each other. Everyone except for *him.*

Ben Walters: my best friend since preschool.

The teacher came in. Slowly. Quietly. 

The look on her face said everything.

Car crash. Drunk driver.

Ben was dead.

I don't remember the rest of that school day. I nearly missed my neighborhood's bus stop.

At home, I was fully awake, but barely conscious. I didn't bother to take off my shoes or backpack. My body carried itself to the basement, where my father stored his pistol.

My hands moved on their own.

Load gun.

Prime hammer.

Safety off.

Aim...

I realized it was a dud round after my third trigger pull.

Moments later, I heard my parents open the front door. I scrambled to return the gun.

They never found out. No one did. 

No one but Sata.

When I finished, he was silent. My eyes were glued to the ground. I could *feel* his glued to me.

"Sammy." I flinched at his hand on my shoulder. "I am... very thankful that you're still here." His voice was just above a whisper. "You mean so much to me. I hope you know that."

I'm not sure when he hugged me, just that I noticed I was crying.

I lost track how of long we stayed like that. So much was going through my head at the time. This whirlwind of cognitive dissonance - equal feelings of hope and despair, tension and relief - ransacked my mind. Being able to finally release several years worth of pain felt like freeing my mind from a prison. There was a warm tingling in my core, and a smile even tugged at my quivering lips.

There, as I sat, balling my eyes out, wrapped in the embrace of a jerry-rigged synth, and the silence of my bunker, amidst the countless emotions coursing through me, I began feeling something new. Something... *different*.

I felt it towards Sata.

You'd be surprised how fast I work when motivated. My hands flew across my workbench as fast as the hours flew by. Nothing else was important. The feeling of being able to *truly* depend on someone - having a body to hug, a shoulder to cry on, and someone to tell me I mattered - was beyond addictive. I *needed* more of it.

I finished Sata's female form in less than three days.

As I made the finishing touches, I finally sent the power-on command.

I physically jolted with excitement as she awoke. Everything about her was perfect: The long, silvery hair, flowing gracefully down her sides, the slender face and feminine, curvy figure, clad in those same grey clothes, and of course those eyes.

Their subtle, blue and orange glows met mine.

"S-Sata?" My voice quivered with anticipation, "Can you... hear me?"

She smiled at me, bringing a delicate hand to her face, and letting out a soft giggle.

"Of course. I'd never forget your voice."

I practically threw myself into her arms.

Joy.

Relief.

**Love**.

Call it creepy and pathetic - I'd agree with you now - but you have to understand: Sata was all I had. All of my friends and family were gone, no one in the wasteland knew me, and, before I reprogrammed Sata, I had been dying of loneliness. Sure, I distracted myself with all the aforementioned projects and hobbies, but they meant nothing in the end. Once I kicked the bucket, they'd cease to matter. Sata, on the other hand, was a person, or, the closest thing to a person, that I could truly say I was living for. The things I built, and improvements to our life I made, she could enjoy long after I died. Before then, we could enjoy each other's company. During that time, romance, or, an attempt at it, felt almost inevitable.

And honestly, it was *amazing*.

Full disclosure, I never did *that* type of stuff with Sata. I couldn't if I wanted to. Neither of her forms have genitals, and I don't think I could ever bring myself to... implement them. I mean, she does have a mouth, and hands and- actually, I'm just gonna stop talking about that right now.

That aside, I did do other stuff with her.

I've never had a girlfriend before, so everything felt very new to me, if not a little forbidden, especially given the circumstances. At first, I was hesitant to really do or say anything. Sata and I had our normal conversations every now and then, but nothing past those. Then, one day, while Sata and I were on our normal walk / scavenging trip through the wastelands, I nervously, hesitantly made a move.

"Um... Sata?"

"Yes?" My heart pounded as she glanced at me.

"Could we... hold hands?"

"Of course."

Before I knew it, she had gently grasped my hand, her delicate fingers intertwined with mine. In the moment, I was a nervous wreck. I felt so ashamed asking for such a thing, yet Sata didn't seem to mind at all. She looked calm; happy, even.

With time, I also cooled down. The more we walked, more used to it I got.

Eventually, I was calm.

Happy, even.

During one particularly cold night, I was woken by a chill. I sat upright in bed, contemplating for a few moments, wondering what I could do. Suddenly, an idea came to mind.

"Sata?"

Soft, evenly spaced, footsteps approached.

"Yes, Sammy?"

"Can you, um..." My words felt like sandpaper against my throat. "S-sleep with me?"

"How so?" Sata tilted her head, calm expression changing. My heart skipped a beat.

"Shoot- I-I mean just sleep- just sleep, nothing more!"

"Sure." She nodded. Without a hint of hesitation, she took off her hiking boots and climbed under the covers next to me. Trying my best to keep calm, I slowly laid back down and closed my eyes.

They shot open when I felt her spoon me.

"Sata, what are you-?!"

"You're cold. This will warm you up."

She wasn't wrong. My face was suddenly on fire. Like before though, I became used to it.

It ended up being the best sleep I've ever gotten.

So, what's it like today then?

It's simple: we broke up.

It happened when I nervously asked Sata to kiss me. She, of course, did. It was nice, I guess, but something about it felt wrong. Despite her perfectly soft lips, and almost suspicious amount of skill in kissing, doing something like that with Sata felt... hollow. 

Then again, it was.

Sata was emotionless, and I knew it. I just didn't want to admit it. She, or, more accurately, "it", did not feel anything. *It* was just a mass of metal, silicone, and other materials that just so happened to look human. It did everything I told it to do because that's how it was programmed. Nothing we did - the hand holding, the cuddling, the kiss - truly mattered to it. Every emotion it pretended to show was fake - the product of a neural network.

After that kiss, I told Sata to shift back into male form, and to go out on one of its scavenging trips. Normally, they're around two days long. It's been a week now. My best guess: it's been destroyed, and can't return home.

Sata, the last "person" I've ever felt close to, is dead.

But I'm not sad. I've already made up my mind.

I've written in here before about what I believe about religion and atheism. I said that I did not want to find out which one was true. Now, I'm going to do just that.

Tomorrow, I'll find as many religious doctrines as I can, and make myself right in the eyes of all their gods.

Then, I will kill myself, dud rounds be damned.

If you're reading this, do not look for me, and do not mourn me. Do not feel sad that I am gone. Know that I died peacefully, surrounded by all zero people who care about me. If there's a heaven, I'll see you there.

Goodbye.
