Everything is so painfully real.
Troy and I ate our first meal today: two cans of Campbells' chicken noodle soup.
It was delicious.
I loved it.
It reminded me of my mom.
I hated it.
I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. My bunker is full of crap I brought in from the surface - food, supplies, tools, materials - everything we need to survive. But what's the point? What's there to come back to? Everything is gone. God, I sound like an emo teen right now. The world's gone, and I'm still complaining about it. I guess the baby boomers were right about us after all. Not that it matters, anymore.

It's 5:00 PM. Troy and I haven't spoken today. Troy hasn't played his violin either. Seeing him so quiet scares me. Before all this happened, he was so bright and lively; one of the friendliest guys you'd ever meet. Half the customers in his mechanic shop he'd end up getting a beer with that night, and he never went a day without adding onto his "dream castle" design. I still remember looking over all the floor plans, plumbing mapping, and electrical diagrams, and thinking he was crazy. Now he's justâ€¦ gone.
I wish he would say something - anything to me.
I bet he's thinking the same thing.

It's 9:00 PM. My hands have started to shake, and I don't know why. I need something to concentrate on. Now.
