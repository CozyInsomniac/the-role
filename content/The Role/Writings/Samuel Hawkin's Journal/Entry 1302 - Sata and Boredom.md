It took me aÂ *long* time to reprogram Sata. For weeks, months even, I spent every hour of every day reverse engineering his source code, modifying it so that Sata wouldn't kill me the moment he gained consciousness. You'd think then, after so much blood, sweat, and tears spent, I would know absolutely everything there is to know about him - how he thinks, what makes him tick - that kinda stuff.
Believe me, I do.
Yet still, he manages to confuse me.
See, he gets "bored" sometimes, and does certain things to entertain himself. Mind you, given he's a synth, the concept of being "bored" doesn't actually exist to him. That, and I didn't (re)program him to be able to be bored. I'd understand if he had components of a human brain in his circuitry, but alas, he doesn't. Sata is complete, cold, hard, logic. Always has been, always will be.
At least, I thought he was.
Here's some things I've seen Sata do to "entertain" himself when he's "bored":

- Sort coins by value, year manufactured, weight, and atomic decay
    
- Comb through Sunflight and I's genomes, check them for errors, then run multiple simulations of what a child between Sun and I would be like
    
    > Currently, Sata predicts simulation 16,734,349,587,142 is the most likely resulting genome. Even I don't know how he came up with that
    
- Monitor weather patterns and radiation conditions around our local area
    
- Run Doom in his brain
    
- Help clean the bunker, and go out on grocery runs with Sunflight
    
    > It was a pain trying getting Sata to understand that "clean" always mean "sterile and polished to a mirror finish."
    
- Count the number of particles in the air
    
- Run aerodynamic simulations on various objects in the bunker
    
- Simulate (several million) games of chess against himself
    
    > I remember this one time, Skyfall got super into chess, became *really* good at it, challenged Sata to a "friendly set of matches", and ended up quitting after losing 46 games in a row.
    
- Balance random objects on top of one another
    
    > I still don't understand how Sata managed to balance 3 pens on top of each other, end to end, but he did it.
    
- Brute-force various encryption standards
    
    > This one genuinely scares me. It took Sata **10 minutes** to brute-force an AES-256 bit encryption key. If you know, you know.
    
- Shoot at his hand with various firearms, and catch the bullets
    
- "Sleep"
    
    > Sata obviously doesn't actually sleep, so instead, he just sits and stares at nothing - unmoving and unblinking - for hours on end. Sun still gets a bit creeped out by this.
    
- Explore the wasteland, and sometimes bring back souvenirs
    
    > Sata's brought back all kinds of stuff; Various electronics, books, silverware, old furniture, cosmetic items, etc. One time he brought back an entire car. I can only wonder what anyone who saw him carrying it thought to themselves.
    
- (With permission), play Sunflight's violin
    
    > Most of the time, Sata only asks to play Sun's violin whenever he brings back a piece of sheet music from the wasteland.
    
- Travel through, then number and catalog various dimensions
    
- Organize my ammo stockpile based on the number of pieces of gunpowder in each bullet
    
- Perform various tricks with various melee weapons in the bunker
    
- Host "conversations" between people he's heard before.
    
    > Mind you, Sata's voice comes through a speaker, meaning he can perfectly replicate pretty much anyone's voice. He's almost a like a (much) smarter parrot in that sense. I''ll never forget the time Sun and I were tricked into thinking that Skyfall, Madeline, Sata, and Snow were all in the weapons room, having a debate over which LEGO set would have been George Washington's favorite.
    
- Have therapy sessions with Sunflight (and, on occasion, myself).
    
    > For an unfeeling and purely logical machine, Sata sure has a scarily detailed and intricate grasp of the mind and emotions. I swear, sometimes it feels like *he* built *my* brain, and it's honestly a bit terrifying. Sun doesn't seem to mind, though. She appreciates the emotional support too.
