This is just a list of improvements and tweaks I've made to my brain and body, thanks to my brain chip. It's nothing special, really; just a place to document my changes. I'll be referring to my brain chip as the "BC" for this changelog.

## BC Version 1.0 Changelog

* * *

## Mental Improvements

- Mental math / object property calculations are offloaded to the BC
- Improved short-term memory and pattern recognition
- Shortened reaction time
- "Freeze" reaction is now suppressed. Will either be replaced with "fight" or "flight".
- Improved blind spot compensation
- Offload directional orientation to BC internal gyroscope when dizzy or disoriented.
- Emotional filter added to suppress strong emotional outbursts
- Implemented actual photographic memory
- Ambidextrous ability added for all "hand" skills
- Real time language translator implemented
- BC performs active garbage collection while awake, decreasing need for sleep
- Improved lucid dreaming ability.

## Bodily Improvements

### Quality of Life Improvements / Optimizations

- Hair growth for different parts of the body can be prioritized or blacklisted.
- Fingernail and Toenail growth can be prioritized or blacklisted.
- Improved tongue biting protection.
- Pain signals can be ignored via `"pain ignore <time to ignore in seconds>"` command
    - Note: Commands are rarely used, and thus must be issued by saying "issue chip command" aloud, followed by explicitly stating the command and itsÂ  parameters. Commands can be cancelled by saying, `"cancel"`
- Hunger is calculated based on an average of body ATP levels rather than when one's last meal was eaten.
- "Random boners" (mostly) removed.
- Smooth eye movement allowed at all times.
- Muscle growth can be artificially caused via intentional rips in the muscle.
- Telomeres are now *fully* replaced with every DNA replication.
    - This theoretically stops aging. May have adverse effects on bodily / mental development.
- Removed Nasal Cycle. Both nostrils will now always be open.
- Goosebumps no longer occur on patches of skin without hair

### Immune System Improvements

- Body cells now perform DNA integrity checks before replicating. Cells will destroy themselves if said check fails. This results in:
    - Better cancerous cell detection / destruction.
    - Better virus DNA isolation / replication prevention
- "B Cell" white blood cells now first reference BC's internal virus database for antibody creation instead of just brute-forcing it.
- Blood now clots much faster
- Allergies removed

### Bodily Enhancements

- Muscle limiters tweaked. Muscles can now exert themselves up to 15% more.
- Lungs have slightly higher capacity (~3%) and slightly higher efficiency (~5%)
- The body can now regenerate all types of cells, including brain cells.
- Number rods in retina increased for better night vision

## "Just For Fun" Tweaks

- Music can be streamed from the BC to the brain.
- Added ability to play 1993 video game DOOM in head.

* * *

## Issues / Bugs

- All commands are issued as root user. May need to change.
- Minor muscle spasms occasionally occur in lower face / left eyelid muscles
- Some **very** strong emotions still make it through the emotional filter
- Random boners still (rarely) occur
- DNA integrity checks are skipped when heavily injured to speed up the healing process. May cause issues with wounds becoming infected and cancer detection.
- Eyes are more susceptible to bright lights due to higher retina rod concentration
- Anger occurs much faster. (Possibly might be caused by the removal of "freeze" response.)
- All forms of growth have been slowed due to DNA integrity checks

## TO DO

- Add creative insult generator
- Add memory suppression / deletion command
- Add ability to issue commands with explicit thoughts
- Isolate skipped DNA integrity checks to only wounded tissue.
- Optimize DNA integrity checks. (Possibly offload to BC?)
