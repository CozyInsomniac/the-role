Fear is a powerful thing.
The fear of death is perhaps it's most powerful form.
Ironically, it's also the rarest.
You don't *truly* know what it's like to fear for your life; not until you've almost lost it. When you're young, you think you're invincible. You don't fear death at all; you don't even *think* about fearing it. The idea never comes close to crossing your mind. Death is something that happens to the old, weak, and sick. It could *never* to someone as young, and strong, and agile, and smart, and aware, and-

You never see it coming.

But it happens.

You almost die.

And it changes you. It changes you a *lot*.

Suddenly, you realize just how fragile you are.

You realize that a car could swerve off the road and hit you.

You realize that a tree could fall on you during your morning walk.

You realize that you could slip and hit your head on a sharp corner.

You realize that you could have an aneurysm at any given second.

What you *don't* realize, is that the fear of death won't stop you from dying.

In fact, it only stops you from living.

In my case, it kept me in my bunker for eighty five days straight. It was the worst eighty five days of my life.
Every day, I sat there - scared, quite, and alone, slowly wasting away inside a glorified steel coffin. Sure, I had food, water, and shelter, but I had nothing to do, nowhere to be, and no one to talk to. Looking back on it, I'm surprised I didn't crack sooner. The silence itself was maddening enough, never mind the self-loathing that came with each wasted day. I so desperately wanted to leave, but after happened to Troy - after I saw those... *things* murder him, I could never bring myself to go back to the surface. The paralyzing fear of death kept me locked away from the world.

Until now.

My hometown - what's left of it - was as I remembered. Most buildings had been reduced to heaps of wood, concrete, drywall, and broken glass. Any buildings still standing were either half destroyed, or complete shells of their former selves. Walls and roofs had collapsed, windows and doors were all but gone, and interiors had gone dark, scarcely lit only by stray beams of sunlight. Even with my steel toed boots and thick work gloves, navigating the debris was a hassle. The ground was littered with lose screws, nails, pieces of rusty metal, and plenty of other conveniently sharp objects waiting to stick themselves into my foot. Nearly every piece of wood I touched left a handful of new splinters in my gloves.
At the very least, I never saw any other people or animals during my trek.
I hope that nothing saw *me*.
It took me about half an hour to reach some less treacherous terrain: a road. I recognized it almost immediately: Maplewood Road. It was the main road my mom always took to drive me to middle school.

The trip was a lot lonelier this time.

I was surprised at how much of my middle school was still left. It was actually still standing, thought I doubt it'll *stay* standing for much longer. I wanted to go inside, but having the place collapse on me would be a death sentence. There wasn't much else to see around the area, and the sun was starting to set, so I headed back to my bunker for the day.
I'll be honest: the main reason I came out of my bunker was to kill myself. I had had enough of slowly dying *inside* my bunker, so I figured I'd find a way to quickly die *outside* my bunker. Instead, as I walked around the corpse of my former hometown, I started to realize just how much I had been needing to go outside. I swear, I could actually *feel* my mind and body healing. For the first time in nearly a hundred days, I could feel the breeze on my skin and breathe natural air. I probably damaged my eyes for how long I stared at the sun.

More importantly, it made me realize: even though somehow, some way, I *am* going to die, I still can make the most of what life I have left. The world may be destroyed, most of humanity may be dead, and there may be a hundred more of those horrid murder machines out there, but you know what? I don't care. I'm still alive and kicking, and I *can* make a difference for myself. If I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in a wasteland, I may as well make it home.
For once, I think I'm excited to wake up tomorrow.
