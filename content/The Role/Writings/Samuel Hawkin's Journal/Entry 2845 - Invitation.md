Hi Mom.
Hi Dad.

It's me. Samuel. Your son.

I know it's a bit surprising to hear from me after all these years. I'm really sorry I stopped writing to you. My life kind of became really hectic one day, and I haven't had much time to write since. I hope this letter can make up for it. There's something really important I want to tell you.

But, before all that, how have you guys been? How is your anniversary date? I hope you're enjoying yourselves. I know you two were really excited for it. Dad wanted me to keep this a secret from Mom, but he's been planning that date for a few months! Make sure to thank him, Mom!

I'll be honest, I didn't expect your date to last this long. I admit, it gets lonely around the house sometimes, but I don't want you to worry. I'm doing alright for myself. Money's not too big of a problem, and I've been getting by on ramen noodles and microwave dinners. I do miss Mom's cooking though. I miss her pasta, and her chicken soup. I really miss hearing her voice humming in the kitchen. I've forgotten it sounds like.

I miss you too, Dad. I wish I could hug you, or hear your car pull into the driveway again. Maybe one day, I can help you fix it again?Â 

I'm sorry. I'm getting off topic. I should tell you want I want to say.

Mom, Dad... I'm getting married.

Her name is Sunflight. She's a very kind and beautiful woman. We love each other a lot. We met a few years ago, just outside our house if you can believe it. She seemed a little started by me at first, but we ended up being really good friends. Now, well, we're a good bit more than that.
Sunflight and I have gone on a lot of adventures. We've been all over the world, doing all sorts of crazy stuff. When you guys get back, I wanna see your faces when I tell you all about them!

Our wedding is in two weeks, on a Wednesday. Consider this letter a formal invitation. I'll send you all the details in my next one. I know this is all a bit sudden, but I hope you can make it to our wedding. I'd love for you to meet Sunflight!

I wish I could write more, but I have to go now. I hope to see you guys soon.

~~Please come back.~~

I love you.
