A few days ago, I met a vampire version of myself. It wasn't V-Sammy; that thing technically isn't even a vampire. He's a succubus demon named Necronyx. Anyways, I met a vampire version of myself, and we actually got along pretty well. He's pretty into tech too, mainly headphones, and he seems like a decent guy. Today, I interviewed him in my Bunker's biology lab to learn more about his kind. My wife wasn't happy about it, but we eventually came to a compromise. For the sake of understandability I'll refer to myself as Sammy, and the vampire version of me as V-Sammy. Again, this isn't the NecroNyx V-Sammy. This is a different one. Anyways, here's the audio transcript from our interview, recorded by Sata.

`RECORDING START`
>Sammy: Cool. You ready?
>
>V-Sammy: Sure. Uh, does... what's his name again?
>
>Sammy: Sata.
>
>V-Samy: Right, Sata. Does Sata really need to be *right* next to me?
>
>Sammy: If it were up to me, no. He's just here to record. My wife insisted he be next to you.
>
>V-Sammy: With the hammer?
>
>Sammy: With the hammer, yes.
>
>V-Sammy: She's *that* scared of vampires?
>
>Sammy: She's had a lot of bad experience. There was this demon - NecroNyx - he took the form of, well, basically you, and... hurt her. A lot. I'd rather not get into the details, but I think you know where I'm going with that.
>
>V-Sammy: Geeze, yeah, no, I- I get it. Sorry for asking, I just-
>
>Sammy: Nah, nah, it's fine. You didn't know. Anyways, should we start now?
>
>V-Sammy: Sure, starting on a real high note, huh?
>
>Sammy: \*scoffs\* I'll say. Alright, first question: what's your name and age?
>
>V-Sammy: My name is Samuel Hawkins and I'm... I think two-hundred and seventy three now? I honestly lost count a while back.
>
>Sammy: An estimation's good enough. So, you said two seventy three? You don't look a day over 25!
>
>V-Sammy: Ha, ha. Funnily enough, I actually do just lie to people and say I'm twenty something. It's a lot easier than explaining my actual age. 
>
>Sammy: I hear that. Did people try to "debunk" your age?
>
>V-Sammy: Not even that. They just thought I was doing a bit, then I'd have to play it off like one cause I didn't wanna correct them and start an argument, and yadda, yadda, you get it.
>
>Sammy: Yep, yep-
>
>V-Sammy: Yeah, I mean, honestly it was worse when they believed me. I don't try to hide the fangs and stuff, and when people see that and hear the age thing...
>
>Sammy: Chaos?
>
>V-Sammy: Yyyyep. I've been punched, rebuked in various gods' names, and a lot of other stuff. Some people are really into the whole vampire thing, and they do *not* hide it around me.
>
>Sammy: I can only imagine...
>
>V-Sammy: Dude, you have no idea. There's a *lot* more people who crank the hog to vampires than-.
>
>Sammy: \*Coughs and starts laughing\* Oh my-! \*continues laughing\* Sorry, sorry I just - "crank the hog" - oh my gosh, that's a good one!
>
>V-Sammy: Heh, yeah. Anyways, there's been a lotta people who were suddenly *really* into me the second they put two and two together. It's always the girls with the black leather chokers that have the metal heart - you know the one?
>
>Sammy: Nah, never seen those-
>
>V-Sammy: It's not really important. But yeah, it's those girls, and a lotta gay guys - well, gay bisexual, whatever - listen, if you're a dude asking another another dude to "suck you dry"- 
>
>Sammy: "Fellas, is it gay to want another man to suck you?"
>
>V-Sammy: Yep, yep, "fellas, is it gay to ask another man to pin you down and **\<CENSORED\>**?"
>
>Sammy: \*laughing\* Oh my God! \*laughing\*. Dude no. No, you did *not* just say that!
>
>V-Sammy: Swear to God, a guy asked me to do that **verbatim**.
>
>Sammy: Oh my gosh... Sata, please censor that in the transcript.
>
>V-Sammy: I told you man. Some people...
>
>Sammy: Yeah, geeze, no kidding! Uh, anyways... moving on. Uh, could you explain some of the vampire stuff?
>
>V-Sammy: What do you mean?
>
>Sammy: Like, how long have you been a vampire and how'd you get turned?
>
>V-Sammy: Oh yeah, yeah. So, I've been a vampire since I was like twenty three. Uh, I was walking in - are you familiar with East Fauxhampton?
>
>Sammy: Nah.
>
>V-Sammy. Oh, well it's a city in Bayborough. Different dimension from this one I think.
>
>Sammy: Probably. It's not like there's many cities left in my dimension anyways.
>
>V-Sammy: Heh, yeah. Anyways, one night I was walking to my apartment when a dude walked up and asked for money. Now, normally I just ignore those kinds of people cause, you know, you never know if they're lying or not, but this guy looked sickly pale - wink, wink, hint, hint - so I offered to take him to a doctor. Seconds later, this dude bites me, and I'm on the ground writhing in pain.
>
>Sammy: Standard crackhead experience.
>
>V-Sammy: \*Scoffs\* Premium experience more like it. Lemmie tell you something: transformation venom - no pun intended - *sucks*. Imagine pepper spray getting injected straight into your veins. I passed out from the pain in seconds, and eventually woke up vampire-ized.
>
>Sammy: Geeze. Just like that, huh?
>
>V-Sammy: Just like that.
>
>Sammy: Yeesh. Uh, you mentioned "transformation venom?
>
>V-Sammy: Right, yeah. So basically, when a vampire bites you, they can either suck your blood, or inject you with either killing venom or transformation venom. The blood sucking and killing isn't that bad since vampire saliva has a numbing agent in it, and the killing stuff, you know, kills you before you can even register the pain. 
>
>Sammy: It kills you *that* fast?
>
>V-Sammy: Takes literally a second at most. 
>
>Sammy: Holy crap.
>
>V-Sammy. Yeah. I mean, it *is* killing venom, so...
>
>Sammy: Is that the official name?
>
>V-Sammy: It's the name I came up with. I dunno if there's some vampire NIST that comes up with the names for this stuff.
>
>Sammy: Heh, you never know.
>
>V-Sammy: Yeah. Anyways-
>
>Sammy: Oh, wait, wait, wait, uh, you said the killing venom takes one second tops?
>
>V-Sammy: Yeah?
>
>Sammy: So you've... killed someone?
>
>V-Sammy: Self defense. Guy shot me.
>
>Sammy: Hm.
>
>V-Sammy: Yeah. Anyways, about the transformation venom, it hurts like hell, then turns you into a vampire in around 10 minutes.
>
>Sammy: You measured?
>
>V-Sammy: No, that was just a guess.
>
>Sammy: Oh, that's fine. So, next question: What are the pros and cons of being a vampire?
>
>V-Sammy: Like, what do I think about it?
>
>Sammy: No, no, I mean the objective stuff. Does it enhance your senses, or make you allergic to garlic or-
>
>V-Sammy. Ohhh okay, no, yeah, there's a lotta stuff. First thing, there's a quite a few buffs. It made me a hell of a lot stronger, faster, more durable - I can't remember the last time I felt tired, and all my senses are dialed to eleven. 
>
 >Sammy: I'd love to ask specifics, but I imagine you haven't taken any measurements-
 >
 >V-Sammy: Yeah, no, I kind of don't have a lab, you know?
>
>Sammy: Fair enough. Uh, can you at least tell me what the enhanced senses are like?
>
>V-Sammy: Day or night, everything I see is crystal clear. Like, I could probably read a book from a hundred feet away while in pitch darkness. Oh, and I can also literally hear your heartbeat from here.
>
>Sammy: I mean, we're sitting pretty close so-
>
>V-Sammy: I can hear your wife's heartbeat too. She's... under a bed in the guest room. I think.
>
>Sammy: ...Impressive. Wait, can you echo locate?
>
>V-Sammy: Oh yeah! I can do that too. I don't do it much though since I'm not blind like an actual bat.
>
>Sammy: Can you hear Sata's heartbeat?
>
>V-Sammy: You're not tricking me. I know he's a robot-
>
>Sammy: Synth, but yeah, you got me. Can you hear the electricity running through him?
>
>V-Sammy: Is that actually a thing?
>
>Sammy: Yeah. Oh, and the sound of his motorized joints.
>
>V-Sammy: I.. can't hear that first thing. The second thing though, yeah.
>
>Sammy: Can you hear dog whistles?
>
>V-Sammy: Yes, they suck.
>
>Sammy: Fun. How about your senses of smell, taste, and touch?
>
>V-Sammy: Touch is pretty much the same, taste is the same too, aside from blood tasting, well, good. Smell is... kinda scary.
>
>Sammy: What do you mean?
>
>V-Sammy: You know how dogs are always sniffing everything?
>
>Sammy: Yeah?
>
>V-Sammy: I get why they do it now. Scent is *extremely* underdeveloped in humans and- sorry, do I sound pretentious when I say "humans"?
>
>Sammy: I mean you're not saying it in a condescending way, so not really.
>
>V-Sammy: Ok, good. I've worried about that. Anyways, people have a really underdeveloped sense of smell. It's hard to describe *exactly* what I can smell that they can't, but you can think of it like being able to see a whole new layer of reality. It feels like I almost have x-ray vision. I can smell emotions, different materials, diseases-
>
>Sammy: Diseases?
>
>V-Sammy: Yeah. In fact... \*sniffs\* I can- wait... oh my God...
>
>Sammy: What? Is everything good, you just went pale. I mean even more pale than you-
>
>V-Sammy: Sammy I'm...so sorry...
>
>Sammy: What do you mean?
>
>V-Sammy: Sammy, you... have rabies.
>
>Sammy: Oh, yeah, I know.
>
>V-Sammy: No I'm serious, you-
>
>Sammy: Nonono, this isn't a bit. I'm serious. You know how I have that chip in my brain?
>
>V-Sammy: Yeah?
>
>Sammy: Well, I actually *grew* that chip into my brain using a modified rabies virus. I had to use rabies since it's doesn't travel in the bloodstream and my immune system wouldn't catch it-
>
>V-Sammy: You gave yourself rabies for a computer chip?
>
>Sammy: I mean... yes.
>
>V-Sammy: You're serious?
>
>Sammy: You smelt the rabies, dude. I'm still alive, so-
>
>V-Sammy: You're insane.
>
>Sammy: No, dude, it was worth it. My brain literally has a built in calculator, translator, dictionary, music player, Wikipedia- 
>
>V-Sammy: What if something goes wrong though? Like, it glitches and the modified rabies somehow becomes normal rabies?
>
>Sammy: I can literally recite every line of my chip's source code to you. I made it airtight, and tested it to hell and back. If something was gonna go wrong, it would have.
>
>V-Sammy: If you're sure...
>
>Sammy: To be fair, I probably could have made the translator's language parser a little bit better, but it gets the job done. Actually, I could probably reduce the time complexity if I-
>
>V-Sammy: Please, leave me out of the programming talk. I'm a music guy, and not much else.
>
>Sammy: Right, sorry. That's enough about me anyways. So, let's talk blood: what's your experience with it?
>
>V-Sammy: I need about a gallon a day. Some blood's better than others, but it doesn't really matter where it comes from, so long as it's from a healthy, live person or animal.
>
>Sammy: I see. Do you get feisty whenever you smell blood?
>
>V-Sammy: I react to the smell of blood the same way people do the smell of food, so... 
>
>Sammy: Ohhhh, okay, I get it. Yeah, I guess that makes sense. You're not like, crazy, but- yeah. Speaking of, can you still eat normal food?
>
>V-Sammy: I can, but doesn't fill me up or nourish me. At least it doesn't feel like it does. I went my first few days as a vampire eating normal food and I felt like I was starving to death by day three. First drink of blood was heavenly.
>
>Sammy: ...What was it?
>
>V-Sammy: Squirrel.
>
>Sammy: Wow... Any cons to being a vampire?
>
>V-Sammy: Absolutely. Sunlight is a no-go. I'll burn in seconds. I think it's more the UV radiation that hurts than the light itself since we're, you know, in a well lit room here, and I'm fine.
>
>Sammy: And you can go out at night?
>
>V-Sammy: Yeah.
>
>Sammy: Okay, makes sense. Moonlight is just reflected sunlight without nearly the same amount of UV, so-
>
>V-Sammy: Yeah.
>
>Sammy: Any other weaknesses?
>
>V-Sammy: I mean, everything that hurts normal people still hurts me. Sure, it hurts a lot less, and I heal faster, but it still hurts.
>
>Sammy: Garlic, silver, crosses, crossing running water?
>
>V-Sammy: Nope. None of that stuff affects me. At least, not any more than it'd effect a normal person.
>
>Sammy: Man, Sun's gonna be disappointed about that one.
>
>V-Sammy: Yeah, I was wondering about that garlic smell around her-
>
>Sammy: Aaaanyways, I think that's just about everything I wanted to ask you. You got any questions for me?
>
>V-Sammy: Not really.
>
>Sammy: Alright. I guess that's the end of this interview then. Sata, you can stop recording and-
