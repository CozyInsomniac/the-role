I'm not numbering this entry since I'll be continuously updating it every time I encounter a new creature.

The wasteland has surprised me with how much biodiversity several lethal doses of nuclear radiation has produced. I would have appreciated, though, it if at least *some* creatures had less "human-centric" diets. That said, here's a list of stuff I've run into up on the surface:
* * *

### Flesh Crabs

**Danger Level:** 6/10
Flesh crabs are the result of a parasitic fungus infecting, and completely taking over, a human host. A flesh crab's skin is a mix of dark green and orange, dotted with small holes which can either leak a viscous yellow puss, or puff out spores. Flesh crabs walk using their host's arms as "front legs", and legs as "back legs". Basically, they move exclusively using the "crab walk" exercise. The host's skull is repurposed as a mouth, splitting open near the top, and turning previous skull bones into teeth. Flesh crabs' are mainly carnivorous, and will try to hunt and eat pretty much anything with a pulse. Their jaws are incredibly strong, and can crunch through flesh, bone, and even thin layers of metal with ease. Flesh crabs are blind, and thus navigate / hunt (quite effectively, might I add) using sound, smell, and touch. Thankfully, they're not that smart, so even with their heightened senses, you generally do have a fighting chance should you encounter one. When fighting flesh crabs, I've found it most effective to take out their limbs first, limiting their mobility, then aim my shots for their chest. I *have* one-tapped a few flesh crabs before, but most take at least two or three well placed shots to go down.

### Tenta-Trees

**Danger Level:** 6/10
Tenta-Trees, or T-Trees for short, are trees that, based on my observations, have been heavily mutated from nuclear radiation. From most angles, they look like normal trees. The only thing slightly out of the ordinary would be their trunk, which somewhat resembles a wine bottle with a shorter body and thicker neck. The trunk starts out very thick and round at the bottom - about 6.5 feet in diameter, before slightly thinning out as it grows upward. There's also one dead giveaway: T-Trees are one of the only trees that aren't completely dead or barren. Basically, if you wanna avoid them, avoid any trees with leaves.
The actual deadly part of T-Trees is the fact that they have a large orifice, somewhat resembling a mouth, on the side of the thicker part of their trunk. Below the "mouth" are a bunch of root-like appendages that rest dormant on the ground. They're different looking than actual roots, though, as they're segmented, and ever so slightly pulse with what I can only assume to be the T-Tree's "heartbeat". Though, if you're close enough to see said pulsing, you're definitely *way* too close. The "roots" cannot see or hear, but they can detect vibrations and are monstrously strong. If you happen to step on or near them, they'll lash out and grab you, then pull you into the creature's mouth. If even one gets ahold of your foot, you're pretty much dead. I once saw a deer get eaten by a T-Tree. The poor thing walked up to the tree to sniff one of the roots, and immediately got nabbed and eaten whole. I didn't even see the T-Tree spit out a skeleton afterwards. The entire thing was just *gone.* I've tried baiting out a T-Tree by throwing stuff like rocks and pieces of debris near its tentacles, and while they do grab the stuff at first, they quickly realize its inedible, then toss it away. I've always wondered what the inside of a T-Tree looks like - if the entire trunk is fleshy - but I've never risked getting close enough to try cutting them open.

### Nuclear Cacti

**Danger Level:** 3/10
Nuclear Cacti are a parasite-human combination. Once infected, the parasite will force it's human host to move to a cool, damp place, then stay there until the parasite can fully mature. Once fully matured, a nuclear cactus looks like a human body frozen in place, covered in a dark blue flesh with pulsing red veins running throughout. Similar to the flesh crabs, these veins leak a viscous, yellow puss. I'm not fully sure what the fluid is, but if I had to guess, it's probably the result of the host's internal organs, fat, muscles, etc, being metabolized by the fungus, then expunged as liquid waste. A nuclear cactus can also re-purpose it's host's bones into serrated spines. When the cactus detects something close by, the spines abruptly shoot out in an attempt to capture the unsuspecting prey. If the cactus manages to catch anything, that animal (or human) is as good as gone. Struggling only ensnares or injures the prey further, and within 12 hours, the prey will be taken over, and become another nuclear cactus. With enough prey, nuclear cacti can make their own interconnected "clusters". As far as I've seen, clusters can grow indefinitely, as long as prey keeps coming along. In terms of fighting nuclear cacti: don't. I have no idea if they have any exploitable weaknesses, and in my experience, bullets only cause puss to shoot out at an *alarmingly* high pressure from the resulting bullet hole. Basically, don't touch or get near these things. Ever.

### Misc. Wildlife

**Danger Level:** Varies / 10
Believe it or not, I *have* seen regular wildlife out here. They're strikingly rare though. Most of them have been deer, rabbits, raccoons, and the occasional fox. The prey animals have definitely changed behavior-wise; They're *super* skittish now. The moment they detect something, they're gone. It's not even like they do a "run away a small distance then look back" type of run either. They *bolt,* and don't look back. If I could guess, they're being hunted far more often now; either by humans, or something else. Truth be told, I might have to do some hunting soon. I'm getting sick of MREs.
Oh, I almost forgot to mention: there *are* also several mutated variants of wildlife I've seen. They tend to have mutated or extra limbs, much higher levels of aggression, and much shorter lifespans than their corresponding non-mutated variant.

### Crows

**Danger Level:** 1/10
I'm giving these guys a separate entry only because I've been seeing a *lot* lately. That, and they've been acting kind of... off. I know that crows are smart birds, but some of the ones I've seen act almost *human* levels of smart. Time and time again, I've caught them watching me intently from afar. The moment I look at them, they fly away. Yet, they always come back. They even try to hide themselves, ducking behind cover, and tucking themselves away in tree branches. Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I *swear* they're following me. I'm almost scared to try and shoot one.

* * *

### Humans

**Danger Level:** 9/10
Literally just other human beings. I call them "raiders". They're highly dangerous due to the fact that they're smart, strategic, manipulative, and often have several guns. A lawless place like the wasteland *really* brings out the worst in people. I've people seen do some horrendous, life (or death) sentence worthy things to other people, including, but not limited to torture, rape, murder, and cannibalism (and not always in that order). For the most part, I stay far, *far* away from others. Most people I meet just end up threatening my life, so I generally just shoot anyone on sight. As for *how* to fight people, a bullet or two to the head is an effective "off" button, as is any significant shots to the internal organs, vital arteries, or genitalia. Well, that last one's not always immediately lethal, but it certainty gives you the upper hand.

* * *

### Synths

**Danger Level:** 10/10
Think humans, but bullet proof, almost perfectly accurate with a gun, and with absolutely no fear, hesitation, or sense of pain. Synths are pretty recognizable from afar, as they consist entirely of a metal skeleton and a weapon. Their extreme physical strength and accuracy with a gun makes them deadly from all ranges. Oddly enough, they're also surprisingly slow. I guess they don't really need to chase targets down if they can just shoot them from half a mile away. The only synth I've seen up close was that one back during my internship at Archon. I believe it was labeled as, "EA-0". I have no idea what the label meant, or even if the thing's still around. Whatever the case, I don't plan on dealing with any synths again any time soon.

* * *

### Dragons

**Danger Level"** ???/10
I'll be honest, I've never actually *seen* a dragon with my own eyes (nor do I want to). But at this point, I'm 99% sure that they're lurking in the wastelands. There was one abandoned town I went to where I found a set of massive claw prints on the ground. Their shape looked *very* dragon-like - large paws with four "fingers" tipped with massive talons, and based on how they appeared, the creature was four-legged. Strangest thing, though, was that they didn't lead to or from anywhere; They appeared and disappeared very suddenly. I assume this means that whatever dragons exist here can fly, teleport, or something else equally terrifying. Either way, I don't wanna think about it. Oh, I've also seen plenty of buildings that had been reduced to ashes, but I couldn't tell if they were burned by dragon's fire breath, or just some bored raiders.
