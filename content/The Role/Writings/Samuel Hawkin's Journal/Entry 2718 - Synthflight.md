For well over a decade now, my life has felt like some off-the-rails game of Dungeons and Dragons. Every day is something new, whether I like it or not. One moment, I'm sleeping peacefully with my wife, and the next I'm fighting for my life. Throughout my years of portal-hopping, I've seen armies wiped out in an instant, travelled through time, and met shape shifting dragons. I've killed hundreds of people, and know death's face better than my own. I'd claim that I've forgotten what fear feels like; for a while, it was true.

Then that **thing** came along.

I've never seen something so deadly, unpredictable, and downright *tragic* as Synthflight.  

And it's my fault she exists.

Let me back up and explain: A few months ago, my mind and consciousness were trapped inside a computer - a digital simulation. I, unknowingly, was at the mercy of whoever controlled that computer. In my case, it was Edrick Phronox, head and CEO of PhanTech; exterminator of my home planet. Without hesitation, Edrick deleted me - literally deleted me. I was taken out of reality. With a simple keystroke, my body, mind, soul, memories - gone.
At least, I thought so.
I don't know how, but someone or something bought me back into the world. Well, my body at least. My memories were still gone, which is probably why I didn't immediately try to murder Edrick when he came to me.
I was an idiot.
Edrick lied to me - pretended to tell me who I was, how we were "friends", and why I didn't remember any of it. I ate it up, and joined forces with the bastard. Looking back, it truly felt like a deal with the devil. He gave a special suit that granted me powers beyond my wildest dreams. With it, I could fly, teleport, effortlessly slice through anything - reality included, and I was practically invincible. I hate to admit that I loved it, but power was such a euphoric high for me. Edrick's technology make me feel like a damned god, and I was ready to follow him to the ends of the universe.

*Was.*

One day, Edrick took me to an orphanage. "New Day" I believe it was called. There, we adopted a child named Scarlet, or, more accurately, Sunflight.

Yes, you read me correctly. We adopted the child version of my wife. It's as disgusting as it sounds, and at the time, I was clueless. I didn't even recognize Sunflight.

That poor kid.

After adopting her, Edrick and I took child Sunflight back to one of synth factories. That's where we made Synthflight: the perfect monster.

I *hate* how clearly I remember it.

Edrick took that poor, young Sunflight, and forced her into this massive, machine. It looked like an industrial oven fused to a meat grinder. After forcing her in, Edrick turned to me and told me to start the machine. It was a simple red button.

Even then, I felt a twinge of guilt and uncertainty. I *knew* something was wrong.

I should have seen past his uncharacteristically gleeful smile.

I should have listened to my gut.

I should have said no.

...

I pressed the button.

Sunflight's screams didn't last long. Her blood quietly seeped out from the machine, pooling on the floor below. When the door opened, Sunflight was gone.


Even as I was then, I felt something off about the whole thing. Yet, like the good little brainwashed sheep I was, once Edrick shoved Sunflight in, I activated the machine, and in minutes, that poor, innocent, terrified little girl was mutilated into a cold,  merciless killing machine. Edrick had made Synthflight, and I helped him.

I'll never live it down. I won't *let* myself live it down. I could have said no. I could have stopped that poor, young Sunflight's murder. But no. Just like I failed to protect my parents and Troy, I failed to protect her. My God, I really don't deserve to be here.

I'm getting off track. I need to focus; the world needs to know. Synthflight is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the most terrifying thing I have ever fought. That thing is like a perfect war machine. It covers all areas of offense. Her wings, arms and legs have retractable jet engines that can propel her at damn near the speed of sound. For long range attacks, she can fire barrages of mini missiles from her back, has a retractable caliber machine gun mounted on her left arm, and a plasma rifle on her right. For mid range, her throat was replaced with a flamethrower that spews white hot flames, and for close range, she's got a set of poison-tipped claws, hard as titanium and sharp as hell. And that's all only what I've seen so far. Lord knows what else Edrick did to her. Oh, I almost forgot to mention: she can travel through dimensions, has 360-degree vision, and is impervious to fire, water, electricity, and bullets. 
I don't know when she'll attack us again, and I honestly doubt Sun and I are gonna survive. Last time she attacked, Sun nearly died, and my armor almost gave out.

I'm sorry. I have to stop writing.

Dammit, I'm shaking again.
