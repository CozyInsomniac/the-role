I love my life.
I live in a literal wasteland, all my friends and family are dead, I risk death every time I go outside, all the meals I eat are glorified TV dinners, and still, I love my life.
The past two, maybe three weeks - I don't know, nor do I care - have been the *most* productive weeks of my life. It's so freeing to not have to worry about school, or a job, or, hell, even the law anymore. Every day I live for *myself*. I don't wake up at 6:00AM because some morning class or 9-5 job requires me to. I do it because it gives *me* more time in the day to do what *I* want. I don't work for a boss. If I screw something up, I fix it and move on. I don't worry about income, bills, or taxes. Everything I use - electricity, water, food, shelter - I make on my own. It's work; It's a **lot** of work. But, it's the most fulfilling work I've ever done. Every day, I can see, and take pride in what I've accomplished, and it only motivates me to work harder.
That reminds me, I've accomplished a *lot* in the past few days.
I've cleared out some of the area around my bunker, renovated said bunker to be a little bigger and more "home-ey", and even made a few makeshift weapons and armor. I have some knives now, and even a homemade 9mm machine pistol with handcrafted ammo to boot. The armor's just some metal plates strapped to fabric and leather, but 's it's better than nothing.
