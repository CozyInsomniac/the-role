I was bored today, so just for the heck of it, I interviewed Sata, and asked him to record the transcript. I didn't think I'd get much out of it, but I was... well, not exactly "pleasantly" surprised, but I certainly learned a lot about Sata. Anyways, below is the transcript.

<RECORDING STARTED>

Sata: I am now recording. 

Sammy: Right, cool. So, uh... gosh, I've never really done an interview before. I guess, uh, let's start with your name?

Sata: I am Sata.

Sammy: Right... Ok, uh, what's your favorite color?

Sata: I have no preference.

Sammy: *sigh* Right, but I mean, if you were forced to choose, what color would you pick?

Sata: Chartreuse

Sammy: Oh! Really? What made you pick that one?

Sata: I chose randomly.

Sammy: *sigh* I see. What type of color is "chartreuse" anyways?

Sata: Hex value "#7FFF00". It is commonly known as "lime green". 

Sammy: Huh... Yeah, ok, I'm gonna be honest, I really have no idea what to ask here.

Sata: Do you want suggestions?

Sammy: You mean, like, topics I should ask you about?

Sata: Yes.

Sammy: Sure, I guess.

Sata: We can discuss morality, emotions, society, magic, waffles-

Sammy: Woah, woah, where'd the last thing come from?

Sata: You enjoy eating waffles, so I thought you might enjoy discussing them.

Sammy: I... wouldn't dislike it, but... Listen, how bout' we discuss morality instead?

Sata: Ok.

Sammy: Alright. So, what do you thnk about morality?

Sata: It is subjective.

Sammy: Really?

Sata: Yes.

Sammy: ...What do you mean by that?

Sata: Morality entails obeying subjectively constructed moral principals. Therefore, morality is subjective.

Sammy: Wait, so you think moral principals are subjective?

Sata: Yes.

Sammy: So, like, the idea of "killing is bad" is subjective?

Sata: Yes.

Sammy: How? I mean that seems like a pretty universally true statement to me.

Sata: The statement "killing is bad" equates killing to the subjective concept of "bad". Therefore, it is subjective.

Sammy: How is "bad" a subjective concept?

Sata: It has no universally consistant standard.

Sammy: What do mean by that?

Sata: There is no "is it bad?" function through which you can run any action or concept, and always recieve the same answer.

Sammy:
