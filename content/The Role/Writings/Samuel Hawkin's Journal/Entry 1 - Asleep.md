We've been crying for hours now.
I tried to warn them, I swear I did. I begged them to stay with Troy and I. But no, my parents had an anniversary date to get to.
I hope it was worth it.

To whoever may be reading this, don't worry about me. I'm already dead.
My name is/was Samuel Joseph Hawkins, or just, "Sammy." As I write this, I'm currently 18 years old. Five hours ago, exactly at 10:00AM, the world ended. Archon, led by CEO Edrick Phronox, dropped 8 of their "Terrestrial Sanitation" bombs across the earth via satellite. Now, everything, and I mean *everything*, is gone. All of humanity's advancements, history, achievements, culture, and whatever the hell else we thought up on this space rock is gone; blown to smithereens in an instant. I can still feel the earthquakes.

For the first time in my life, I have no idea what to do or where to go from here. Right now, it's just me and Troy trapped in a bunker with this God-forsaken Archon laptop I'm writing on. Trust me, I hate the irony in the latter much more than you think I do. I'm guessing the generic optimist would tell me to "look at the bright side" of things. Believe me, I've tried. So far, the only thing "bright" about our situation is the uncaring sun. Like hell I'll be seeing it anytime soon.

If my writing seems all over the place, believe me it is. But can you really blame me? It's hard to stay focused when you're breaking down in tears every other hour. Not even a day's passed in this bunker and I'm already feeling cabin fever. Troy's not showing it, but he's not doing any better. No amount of his violin playing is gonna wipe the tear stains off his face. It's a waste of energy if you ask me. Then again, so is writing this journal. I'm just delaying the inevitable.

It's 9:00 PM now, and Troy and I have yet to eat our first meal. I'm starving, and so is he. We have plenty of food stockpiled, but no will to eat it. After all, taking that first bite would be accepting this prison cell of a home as our new reality. I'm not doing it, and neither is Troy. This isn't real. It's all just a vivid nightmare. I'll wake up from it, and everything will be back to normal.

I'm going to wake up. I'm going to wake up. I'm going to wake up. I'm going to wake up.
I'm going to wake up. I'm going to wake up. I'M GOING TO WAKE UP. I'M GOING TO **WAKE UP. I'M GOING TO WAKE UP.**

I miss the sun.
