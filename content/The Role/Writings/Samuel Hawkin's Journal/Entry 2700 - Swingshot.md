I would best describe Sunflight's axe as a massive slap to my face.
It's the type of slap someone gives you for no reason; the type that makes you go, "What the hell was that for?", and, for a split second, makes you consider murdering another human being. Hours later, you're still angry about it.

But I'm not angry.

I'm thankful.

Because not only was this a slap that could make a pacifist commit genocide, it was a slap that could make a blind man see. Oh, how blind I've been.

Sun's axe, Swingshot, is a weapon to behold. It's a hybrid between a battle axe, a shotgun, and a sniper rifle. But, that's not the part that keeps me up at night.

It's the material.

Sun calls it "celestial bronze", and it's the most amazing alloy I've ever laid eyes on. This stuff is *impossible* levels of strong. There's like one or two things that it hasn't sliced through like butter, and in the past several years I've known Sunflight, I've only ever seen her sharpen her axe once. I did a heat test on it, and it took $4000\degree$C of heat like it was nothing. The *furnace* looked like it was gonna melt first. I had Sata try to bend it, and he can't even make it flex.

Let me reiterate: Sata is strong enough to literally tear me **and my armor** apart, and he can't even put a *degree* of bend in this thing. By the way, have I mentioned how light this thing is? The first time I saw Sun swinging it around, I genuinely thought it was made of cardboard. Metal is *not* supposed to travel that fast so easily. Celestial bronze is nothing short of jaw-droppingly amazing. I don't think Sun really understands just how incredible that weapon of hers is. One day though, I'll be sure to thank her a thousand times over for showing me this amazing material if I ever make some myself.

If.

Have I mentioned? I have NO IDEA how to make this stuff. NONE. I've run millions of simulations on almost every possible combination of elements on the periodic table, and there isn't a single compound that comes close to matching even *one* of celestial bronze's properties. Not only do I not have a "ballpark" idea of how to make this stuff, I don't think the ball's even in the same *dimension* as the ballpark. I feel like a newborn trying to do multi-variable calculus.

One day though, I'll figure it out.

Maybe.
