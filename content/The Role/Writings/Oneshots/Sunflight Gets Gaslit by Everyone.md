Sunflight wakes up in Cirrus' house to find her wedding band missing. She goes downstairs to ask her family about it, and they all strangely claim that she was never married. After an increasingly awkward conversation, Sunflight goes out to try and find Sammy. She considers going to her old house, but that would take days. As she flies, she checks to see if she's in a dream, and finds out that she's not. She then wonders if she's in an alternate dimension. As she does, she discovers Sammy, Madeline, and Sata walking around. Sunflight knows that it's her Sammy 100%, and there's only one Madeline in the multiverses, so she knows it's Madeline. They seem to be dragon researchers. Sunflight asks if any of them remember her, and of course, they don't. She tries claiming that she and Sammy and married, but Sammy rebukes this idea, and shows that he and Madeline are in fact married. Madeline is nothing like her normal self; she has her normal red eyes and blood weaver, but is calm, intelligent, and seems romantically uninterested in Sunflight. Sunflight tries to jog their memories, but fails. She calls on Angel, and even Angel claims that she has never known Sammy, Sata, or Madeline.
