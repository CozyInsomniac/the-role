Sammy regretted doing this sober.

 He disinterestedly flicked his flashlight this way and that, scanning the surrounding office cubicles for anything remotely interesting. The walkie talkie on his hip crackled to life. 
"Overlord to Bunker Roach. Come in Vault Roach. Over."
Sammy rolled his eyes and unclipped his walkie talkie.
"What do you want, Madeline?"
"Vault Roach! What did I say about using code names?! Over."
"I'm not using your fake names for your fake ghosts. And, no, I haven't seen any."
"Hot Stuff, what about you? Ov-"
"I told you not to call me Hot Stuff," Sunflight's voice came through the speaker, "And I haven't seen anything either."
"...Keep looking guys. Overlord out."
Sammy still couldn't figure out which was more unbelievable: Madeline getting hired by Microsoft to hunt ghosts, or her convincing both Sunflight and him to tag along. Granted, she had only convinced Sunflight at first, but Sammy wasn't gonna leave Madeline alone with his wife again. Especially not after the last kidnapping. 
As he rounded a corner, Sammy narrowly dodged a chair came hurdling past his face.
"What the?!" Sammy gaped at the chair as it clattered to the ground.
His heart raced.
His blood ran cold.
"No," Sammy whispered, "t-this can't be real..."
He reached a shaking hand out and touched the chair. His heart skipped a beat.
"Oh my God."
Sammy flopped onto the chair and almost moaned in ecstacy.
"Herman Miller Aeron, Size B, adjustable Posturefit SL, fully adjustable arms with leather arm pads, multi surface casters with Quiet Roll... $2,340 retail value."
He leaned back and sighed in delight.
"I'm in heaven."

"I know you're in here!" Madeline sung into the darkness as she twirled Blood Weaver. "Come on out, don't be shy!"  
"You're new." A chilling, female voice ticked her ear
Madeline whipped around and slashed with Blood Weaver. Nothing.
"Where are you!?" She demanded as she frantically looked around.
The voice giggled.
"Where am I?" The voice asked back mockingly, taking on a more masculine tone?
"Am I here?"
"Or maybe here?"
The voice seemed to teleport with every line. 
"Or maybe I'm..."
Madeline braced herself, clutching Blood Weaver tightly.
"Show yourself coward!" She shouted.
Silence.
Stillness.
"**Boo.**"
Madeline yelped and leapt back as the form of a man appeared right in front of her face. It wore a grey dress polo and khaki shorts. In one hand it carried a brief case, and in the other, a cigarette. The polo was peppered with stab wounds, and stained with long-dried blood.
Its entire form was semi-transparent.
"Die!" Madeline swung at the ghost. It teleported back and gave her an amused grin.
"Pretty sword, pretty girl." It commented as it easily dodged several more attacks. "Pretty... bad skills."
"Shut up!" Madeline hurled Blood Weaver at the ghost. It missed, and embedded itself into a wall.
"Are you the new hunter?" The ghost asked sweetly. It morphed into another form - a man dressed in a black jacket, jeans, and combat boots. Its eyes were paper white. "He was the last hunter." The ghost said. "He lasted all of thirty seconds."
Madeline summoned her sword and stabbed. Another miss.
The ghost sighed. "Ugh, you're all the same." It morphed into a female with a dark blue work dress. A bullet hole was visible in the side of her head. "So violent, so helpless." It dodged another attack. "Such easy prey."
"Big talk." Madeline spat. "You make one slip up, and you're dead. Again."
"Oh?" The ghost grinned, eyeing Madeline with a look as if it had been waiting for her to say that. "Is that so?" It floated in from of Madeline and held its arms out. "Go on then."
Madeline swung; stabbed. Blood Weaver phased right through the ghost.
"You think you're unkillable with your fancy tricks. I'll find a way-" Madeline started
"My turn!" The ghost suddenly shot forward, punching Madeline in the gut and sending her flying across the room. She sputtered and coughed as she got up. That had actually *hurt*.
"Oh dear..." The ghost pouted. "And here I thought this would be hard..."
"What do you..."
Madeline trailed off as several more ghosts phased in from ceiling, floors, and thin air.
"Well fuck."
