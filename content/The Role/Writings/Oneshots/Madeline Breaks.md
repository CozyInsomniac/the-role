She had been pacing for hours now.

"My memories." The woman mutters to herself. "Someone took them. I *know* someone took them!"
Madeline stops. She takes a deep breath, and leans against one of the cave's walls. "Come on." The woman racks her brain. "Come on; think, THINK!" She slams her fist against the wall, leaving behind a rather large crack.

It all just didn't make sense. Somehow, someway, Madeline knew who Sunflight and Sammy were. She knew that she obsessed over Sunflight, and yet never made significant advances. This massive blade that she carried around, she somehow knew how to use. Her recklessness, cockiness, and confidence. It all felt to natural to her.

But *why?*

Why did she know these people? Why did she act this way? Where did it all come from?
How the hell was she even thinking this in the first place?

The thoughts were starting to drive Madeline crazy; well, crazier than they already had. There was some bit of knowledge - some small piece of the puzzle she was missing. Someone had taken it, and she was hell bent on finding them.

But who could even do such a thing? Who could so effortlessly, yet incompletely erase her memories? A god? A demon? Some all powerful being?

Wait...

Her memories had been *erased.*

Erased? Like... a pencil on paper? Like an author would their character?

**An author.**

Madeline's heart skips a beat.

It's as if a dam had suddenly broken in her mind; letting lose a torrent of realizations. All at once, 

Madeline realizes:

"THE AUTHORS' HOUSE!"

Seconds later, Madeline is walking towards the structure.

Well, calling it a structure would be oversimplifying it.

The Author's House is more a concept - an idea set outside of time and space itself. It just so happens to take the physical form of a nicely built house.

Madeline walks up to the door.

She doesn't need to knock.

"Hi Madeline." A-Sammy's knowing voice greets from behind her.

Madeline whips around to face the Author. He stands about ten feet behind her, on the Authors' House's front "lawn", hands politely folded behind his back.

"**You.**" She growls, voice laced with venom.

She storms up to the Author, thrusting her sword in his face. A-Sammy doesn't flinch. His expression seems neutral, though there is a hint of sadness in his eyes.

"Give my memories back." Madeline demands. "Right **now.**"

"Madeline, you specifically requested that I erase them. You couldn't handle the realization of-"
"SHUT UP!" Madeline snaps. "I don't care what excuses you have. I don't care what I asked for, or I asked for it. I can handle getting my memories back." The woman's knuckles turn white with how tight she's clutching her sword. "It's called 'character development' haven't you ever written it before?" She sneers.

A-Sammy lets out a short sigh. He brings a hand from behind his back. In it is a USB stick simply labeled, "Madeline." The stick glows a soft, golden color, before transforming into a syringe filled with a clear liquid, and touting the same label.

"Inject it, and you'll get them back." A-Sammy states, his voice laced with a pained disappointment. Madeline immediately snatches the syringe from his hand and jabs it into her arm, firmly squeezing the liquid into her body. The syringe vanishes into thin air.

Then it hits her.

Like a truck?

Like a train?

Like a nuclear bombs?

No. That'd all be putting it lightly.

It feels like her mind is simultaneously exploding into being and collapsing into a black hole. All her memories - finding Blood Weaver, meeting Sammy and Sunflight, going to their wedding, fighting V-Sammy, being with Agnia, watching him die...

...Losing her mind, and asking for her memories to be erased.

It's all clear as day.

Blood Weaver falls to the ground with an audible *clang.*

Madeline's breath hitches. Her hands start to shake. She looks at them with fear, as if this was her first time seeing them. Her breathing becomes ragged - more labored - as she stumbles back, heart now beating out of her chest. She suddenly falls, her back coming down hard on the ground.
A-Sammy does nothing. He knew this would happen.

And now, Madeline knows it too.

She starts to giggle.

It grows into a laugh.

A heart laugh.

A cackle of insanity.

Madeline, in hysterics, brings her hands to her head.

She can't stop laughing, and she knows it.

"Ha..." She squeaks out, "You bastards."

A scream claws its way up her throat.

It spills out into her hands - into the open air. Even to A-Sammy, it's blood-curdling.
Madeline screams again, almost as if trying to scare away her laughter.

She scrambles to her feet, but ends up falling to her knees.

Hysterics mixes with more screams. Madeline slams her fist to the ground.

"STOP IT!" She wails, "**STOOOOOOP!**"

She looks up at A-Sammy, tears starting to run down her face.

"FUCKING *STOP!*" She shouts, "STOP MAKING ME DO THIS! **FUCK!**"

Ever so slightly, A-Sammy's mouth wavers. His sorrow is peeking through.

"LET ME GO!" Madeline continues her shouting, "LET. ME. FUCKING. GO!"

A-Sammy looks away, pursing his lips. Knowing this would happen doesn't make it any easier to watch: The curse of 4th wall awareness. The realization that every action you take - every thought you think - is written; preconceived. The realization that you truly have no free will.

Madeline was laughing again.

"You think it's funny?!" She snaps, "You think just cause you *made* me that I'm your fucking puppet?!" Madeline flinches, smacking the side of her head, "Gah, STOP!"
Somehow, she makes it to her feet, grabbing Blood Weaver on the way up.

"You're pathetic." She spits. "I fucking *hate* you."

A-Sammy looks back at Madeline. It takes all his effort to hold back the tears welling in his eyes.
"I gave you what you wanted then... and I gave you what you wanted now." He pauses, taking a deep breath. "You are my character and... I'm sorry. I love you."

Madeline clenches her teeth.

"Fuck you."

She portals herself away.

A-Sammy finally breaks down.
* * *

"Aaaand that's game!" Sammy was finally getting better at these Pyrrhian card games.

"Well done." Skyfall nods, a smug smile stretching across his lips. "Though, I was going easy on you."

"Sure." Sammy chuckles, "Wanna play another r-"

The sound of a portal opening catches their attention.
The two look over to see Madeline. The woman looks back at them, a dark grin across her face.
She giggles.

Sammy and Skyfall didn't stand a chance.

"Sammy? Sky?" Cirrus walks into the room, having heard the commotion. "What's going..."
He freezes. Before him is Madeline, standing above the bloodied corpses of his son and son in law.
"You like that?!" Madeline shouts at the sky. "You like when I kill your precious fucking characters?!"
Cirrus spares no time in attacking. The Spearwind is beyond infuriated. He lunges forward, fully ready to rip this insane scavenger to pieces.

If only.

Sunflight comes home not too long after.

She sees Madeline.

She sees her dad, brother and husband, dead.

She joins them.

"Aw, what's wrong?!" Madeline laughs, "Is that not how your story was supposed to go?! Is this going 'off book?!'"

She portals away again. This was only the beginning.

* * *

Madeline spared no expense in murdering everyone she had ever known, and then some. Malory, Snow, Raven, Synthflight, Karina, V-Sammy, Sata, Edrick, and an insurmountable number of side and alternate dimensions characters. She trashed Sammy's bunker, drove every Pyrrhian and Pantalan tribe to extinction several times over, and turned a hundred earths into lifeless husks of their former selves. Days, weeks, months flew by in the blink of an eye, yet still, Madeline continued to kill.

One day, Madeline realized just how little of an effect she had. She realized that there were infinite realities, and infinite dimensions.

She realized the Authors could easily revert everything she had done.

And, with a snap of their fingers, that's exactly what they did.

To Madeline, it was hilarious.

One day, she stopped her murder spree. She portalled herself into an empty dimension - an infinite 
void of nothing, where no time could pass.

She portalled her sword away.

And she stayed.

Millennia passed.

Long after every character had naturally died, long after the Authors had finished their story, hell, even long after the Authors themselves died in the real world, Madeline was still there.

She said nothing.

She did nothing.

Eventually, Madeline stopped thinking.

Unable to die, she stayed there.

Forever.
