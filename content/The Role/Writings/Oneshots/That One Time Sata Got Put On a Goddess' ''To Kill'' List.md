Silent as the night around him, Sata practically floats through the dense woods. Against a thick carpet of dead leaves, dried twigs, and occasional branch, his footsteps are quick, yet calculated. His gaze is restless, unblinking eyes darting from tree to tree, each one prompting the same broadcast across the synth's mind:

`Match Failed: Incompatible tree.`

By this point, anyone would have called it quits. Sata had yet to find a *single* compatible tree, despite checking three hundred seventy-two of them.

`Match Failed: Incompatible tree`

Three hundred seventy-three.

Of course, being a synth, Sata's mind never grew bored or weary. It didn't need sleep or motivation. For all he cared, Sata could (and would) unhesitatingly keep searching for the right tree until the heat death of the universe. After all, as Sammy had put it, this mission was critical - "A matter of life and death."

**"Halt!"**

A female voice barks at Sata. The voice booms with tremendous strength and authority. With but one word, it could bring an army to its knees.

Sata keeps walking. 

"Hey!" Sata's audio sensors pick up on the notching of an arrow. "I *know* you can hear me, *boy*. I command you to halt!"

The synth does not halt.

A *twang!*, then sudden whistling.

In one swift motion, Sata turns, his hand shooting forward to catch a glistening silver arrow by the tip. In the pitch blackness of the forest, he can still see a small crowd of human girls standing about twenty feet in front of him. All of them are clad in white shirts, silver ski jackets, blue jeans, and black combat boots. Each girl radiates a slight silver glow, each carries a loaded silver bow, all of them leveled at the Sata. Some are aimed at his head; others, his would-be crotch. 

The Hunters of Artemis. Sata had detected them two minutes ago.

One girl, looking about eighteen years old, steps forward. Her chestnut brown hair slightly sparkles with a silver glow, as her piercing silver eyes glare daggers at the synth. "Explain yourself." She demands in the same authoritative voice from before. "Why have you trespassed in my forest, *boy*?" She spits word *boy* as if it were a slur. 

"I am not trespassing." Sata replies bluntly. He had checked the property ownership records beforehand. "My mission is classified. Leave me alone."

"You will speak to milady with honor and respect, *boy*!" A different, younger-sounding girl snaps from the small crowd. Sata says nothing.

"Neither lying nor stubbornness will get you nowhere." The first girl says. "You have one more chance, *boy*. Tell me why you are here, and I *might* just let you live."

"Milday, he's already lied once. There's no point in letting this male-"

`[sata@SataOS ~]$  bodySwap --female`

A chorus of motors and servos whir to life beneath Sata's synthetic skin. In seconds, the synth's body completely transforms. His neck slims, and his face becomes smoother, his jaw less angular. As his waist becomes thinner, and shoulders closer together, his hips widen, thighs and breasts becoming larger and more pronounced. The synth's hair rapidly grows from neck-length to waist-length, and his eyes swap colors.

"I am not male, and I am not lying." Sata, now in female form, says in a distinctly feminine voice. While the majority of Artemis' Hunt is gobsmacked at the sudden transformation, the goddess herself only cocks a brow. In a sudden flash of light, she's right in front of Sata, the tip of her bronze hunting knife pressed against the synth's throat. Sata doesn't flinch. 

"I do not want to fight." Sata says, softly, "But I will not hesitate to defend myself." 

Artemis smirks. 

"So, what exactly *are* you then?" The goddess questions, pushing her knife harder against Sata's throat. Clearly this thing wasn't human, demigod, immortal, or monster. The strange hammer mounted to its back was also quite an eye-raiser. Perhaps it was an automaton? If so, Hephaestus would be disappointed to see *another* one of his toys smashed to pieces. Then again, he deserved it after what happened last week. Whatever the case, this odd, grey-haired thing wasn't allowed in her forest.

"Leave me alone." Comes Sata's response. "Or else I will use force."

"Oh, please do." Artemis coos. "I'd like to see you try."

With literal millennia of combat experience under her belt, plenty of divine power at her disposal, immortality, and literal godlike skill at melee and ranged combat, she had lost count at how many times she had been threatened with violence. Most of her fights, she ended in three moves or less. The stronger opponents sometimes lasted for four. Needless to say, she was more than ready for any attack that this thing could throw at her.

She was *not* expecting to go blind. Never mind be sent flying into the nearest tree.

When the goddess' eyes heal half a second later, half her Hunt has already broken off to chase the intruder, spouting out curses and death threats that could make a Minotaur cry. The other half runs to her aid, their concerned voices barely audible over the ringing in Artemis' ears.

"Don't... worry about me." Artemis coughs out, rising to her feet. The impact hurt like Hades, but she'd been through worse. "Go! After the intruder!" 

It doesn't take long for the entire Hunt - Artemis included, to be hot on Sata's trail. As she sprints through the woods, Sata continuously dodges an both onslaught of silver arrows, and the occasional beam of concentrated moonlight. Sata's mind is a hurricane of calculations. All at once, she's processing gigabytes of new environmental data, deciphering the fastest escape route, measuring the temperature of several internals components, and, of course scanning any new trees. With a crowd of angry huntresses on her tail, Sata doesn't dare slow her pace.

`Match Success: Compatible tree found!`

Sata skids to a halt, heels digging ankle-deep into the dirt. 

The Hunt descends upon her.

The battle is a cacophony of arrows, blades, and a certain, heavy-hitting hammer. Within the chaos, Sata fight against the Hunt in an almost dance-like display of precision and control. With every dodge, an attack misses her by less than a hair's breadth. With every swing of her hammer, there's one less opponent... and blood.

A *lot* of blood.

A blast of moonlight almost catches Sata off guard, as Artemis soon joins the fight. It turns out that dodging tens of arrows whilst battling several highly trained huntresses is a lot harder when an enraged goddess is also after you. Sata had already used her engraving laser at full power to temporarily blind Artemis, along with her "Mach" ability to send the goddess flying. Both would take some time to recharge, the latter especially. Several arrows strike and bounce off of Sata's synthetic skin as she tries her best to defend against Artemis' increasingly fast furious swings. The knives, made of celestial bronze, can easily slice through Sata's hammer, so dodging is the synth's only option. Maybe Sata could wear the goddess out?

One of Artemis' stray swings leaves a deep gash in a nearby tree.

`Warning! Compatible tree damaged!`

Never mind. This fight ends *now*. 

Sata instantly hurls her hammer to the side, turning a nearby Huntress' top half into a cloud of red mist. As Artemis lets loose another lightning fast swing, Sata catches her arm, twisting the weapon out of the goddess' hand and kicking her square in the stomach. The goddess stumbles back, though not without her other knife leaving a deep gash across Sata's face. 

"Gah, you thieving little-!"

Blades clash as Sata and Artemis engage in rapid, one-on-one combat. Artemis' millennia of experience paired with Sata's nearly instant reaction time and flawless motion makes for a deadly combination. Their blades are a blur, as every attack and parry is executed with near perfection, and made with barely milliseconds to spare. The Hunters - what's left of them - are either attending to the injured, or have gathered to watch the fight, having realized their arrows have no effect.

Of course, nothing lasts forever.

All at once, Sata and Artemis plunge their knives into each other's necks. Artemis screams in pain, whilst Sata's eyes flicker, hundreds of errors and warnings running through her mind as several emergency systems kick in.

Artemis stumbles back, thick, shiny ichor gushing from her stab wound. 

"Retreat!" The goddess chokes out, "**Retreat!**"

In a flash of light, the goddess, along with the rest of her hunters, disappear.

Ignoring the ichor, Sata retrieves her hammer, and tends to the tree.

"Man, what's taking him so long?" Sammy asks aloud as he fiddles with his MG at the dinner table. Sata had been gone for two hours now.

"You know him better than I do." Sunflight replies, prepping some cuts of meat for lunch. "You sure you sent him to the right forest?"

Almost as if on-cue, a portal opens in the kitchen. Out walks Sata, a mason jar full of clear, watery liquid in each hand.

"Sata!" Sammy stands, a grin on his face. "About time!"

"I have retrieved the sap." The synth states, handing the jars to Sammy.

"Thanks." Sammy nods, "Finally, I have have some *fresh* maple syrup with my waffles! By the way, Sata. why are you in female form?"

"Hm?" Sunflight turns from the chopping board, "Oh my gods, Sata! What the fuck happened to you?!"

"This?" Sata points to the celestial bronze knife, still stabbed deeply in her neck. "I had a run-in with the Hunters of Artemis. Do not worry. I dealt with them."

"Oh gods..." Sunflight facepalms. "This better not start another war."
