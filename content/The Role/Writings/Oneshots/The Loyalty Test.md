Sammy froze. He recognized that scent. That intoxicating blend of rose, jasmine, and patchouli was unmistakable.

He turned to meet the gaze of a beautiful young woman whose appearance gave perfection a run for its money. Her face, hair, and eyes, practically glowed with an ethereal beauty, while her body, curvy in all the right places, was daintily complimented with a perfectly-fitting halter dress. Even a mere glance at her could make even the most prudish of persons infatuated.

Sammy eyed her like an unwanted pest.

"What do you want, Aphrodite?" He spat.

The goddess crossed her arms with an adorable pout.

"Well hello to you too." She said, her voice as smooth and sweet as fine wine.

Sammy remain silent. He crossed his arms and tapped his foot impatiently as his brain chip worked overtime to prevent the sudden rush of blood to his nether regions.

"I *said* what do you want?"

"Ugh, rude." Aphrodite hummed. "You wanna have better sex with Sunflight?"

Had Aphrodite been anyone less than the literal goddess of love, Sammy would have slapped her. Instead, he only heavily considered it.

"Aphrodite, are you seriously about to give me Viagra?"

"Of course not! That stuff's cheap garbage anyways. I'm here to give you something much better then pills~"

The goddess gave him a mischievous smirk. Sammy narrowed his eyes. If this was going where he thought it was going...

"And what would that be?"

"A harem!"

To be fair, Sammy hadn't expected that. Still-

"Absolutely not. I'm married."

"Sunflight's not even here right now though. Aren't you lonely?"

"She at a family get-together in Pyrrhia, and she'll be back in a week. I'm fine."

"Come on! Isn't it enticing? And it's free!"

"No."

"Sunflight won't ever know about it!"

"No."

"Most men would kill to get something like this!"

"I wouldn't."

Aphrodite growled. Why was Sammy so stubborn?

"It's an infinite supply of whatever women you want! You can do whatever you want with them, whenever you want! How can you turn that down?!"

Sammy's expression softened.

"I'm sorry, did you say 'whatever women I wanted'?"

Aphrodite's glare melted. Did that actually work?

"Of course!" She immediately rekindled her typical personality. "And I do mean *whatever* women you want. Any age, any species, any body... *anybody*. I could even give you a clone of anyone you've ever met! Love knows no bounds, after all."

"And they could have any personality I want? Any mindset?"

"Why of course!" Aphrodite smirked, gently biting her bottom lip. "Got something in mind?"

"You know what? I think I do..."

Sunflight sighed as she laid back down in the grassy field. As much as she loved her family, being around them, especially her extended family, was exhausting. If she had to hear one more rant from Summit about scavengers being scum of the Earth...

She shook her head. That was all over now. Now was the time to relax a bit.

"Oh Sunfliiiiiiight!"

Goddammit.

Sunflight cringed. She could recognize that sickly sweet voice from anywhere. She turned to see Aphrodite with an all too familiar, proud expression. Seriously? *Another* loyalty test?

Sunflight would have preferred Madeline.

"What's up, Aphrodite?" She asked, hoping to end this interaction as quickly as possible.

"I have news for you." The goddess cooed.

"And that is?"

"Sammy's been cheating. A *lot*."

Sunflight froze. Her jaw clenched, hands formed fists. A deep, fiery rage erupted in her as her body started to smolder, and eyes started to glow with malice.

At least, that's what she had done the *first* time Aphrodite had used this line on her. Now, it was getting old.

"Get some new material. I've heard this one before." The Skywing said disinterestedly.

"I'm serious. I even have proof."

Sunflight faltered. Aphrodite had never claimed that one before.

"And what would that be?"

"Well, a week ago, I may or may not have offered Sammy a harem, and he may or may not have accepted it, and I may or may not have set up a few hidden cameras to record everything that happened afterwards!"

"..."

"Ohh, so now you believe me, hm?"

Aphrodite waved her hand, bringing up a screen of mist.

"I was gonna watch these before, but I wanted to see your reaction, so this'll be the first time for both of us!"

"Shut up and play it."

Aphrodite giggled, and, with another wave, started the "video tape".

***
*"You know what? I think I do."*

*"Ohhh, splendid! Tell me, what do you want?"*

*"I want a twenty two year old human woman who grew up without a father figure, but desperately wants one."*

*"A literal daddy kink, hm? I never thought you the type!"*

*With a wave, a beautiful woman matching Sammy's description appeared. She was quickly at Sammy's side, clinging to his arm.*

*"I'll leave you two to it~"*

*With that, Aphrodite vanished.*

The clip ended.

Sunflight stared at the now blank screen, mouth agape. There was no way.

"That wasn't his only request!" Aphrodite practically sung. "Have a look!"

Sunflight was a hurricane of emotions as she watched Sammy request dozens of women, each more horrifying than the last.

*"A twenty year old mother who lived on a farm as a kid, but moved to the city."*

*"An elf girl who's only lived in a secluded village for her whole life."*

*"An eighteen year old catgirl who has the mental capacity of a fifteen year old."*

*"A blue haired icewing dragon girl with the same brain as Sunflight when I first met her, but with twice as much PTSD."*

Sunflight's distress was *delicious*. Aphrodite had been waiting for so long to finally entice her or Sammy into cheating. The drama would be incredible. She had a certain idea for celebration in mind.

"How about we watch Sammy have sex with one of the women now?"

Sunflight was quiet. Broken. Burning with rage.

"Sounds like a yes to me!"

Another wave of Aphrodite's hand.

*Sammy and his newest request, a vampire girl, walked into frame. They were in the lab.*

*"So honey, wanna get bloody?"*

*"Yes. Hey Sata, do it!"*

*"Wha-"*

*There was a scream, then a thud, as Sata cleanly decapitated the woman, tore her skull in two, and pulled her brain out.*

*"Come on, quick quick! Brain death could be a lot faster for vampires!"*

*Sammy and Sata rushed the brain into a containment tank filled with an odd liquid... and a whole bunch of other brains.* 

Aphrodite's grin dropped.

"...What?"

*"Alright, that makes ten. Run another simulation and see if the extra brain gives that speed boost we were looking for. It should take about an hour - just enough time to make ol' Aphrodite think I did the hanky panky with em'. I'll order another if it's too slow."*

*"Understood."*

Aphrodite watched in horror as Sammy used the women's brains as makeshift CPU's to run what looked like a supercomputer. He hadn't had sex with any of this harem members. Instead, he had...

*Oh, and Sata, don't forget to harvest the organs and raw materials. I think I could use this one's eyes to make a night vision scope!*

Holy shit.

The clip finished, and the screen vanished. Aphrodite and Sunflight sat in shocked silence.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Sunflight spoke.

"I... I don't know if this is better or worse than him cheating."
