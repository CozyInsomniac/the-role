## Description

### Appearence

- Chronos is a smart wristwatch manufactured by Samuel "Sammy" Hawkins during early 2021. The watch has a black and yellow, linked metal band, and large, square case. The case is 2 inches wide and long, and half an inch thick, and is lined with a shiny, almost mirror-finish trim. The watch's face consists entirely of a high resolution digital display (600x600 px), and the front of the case contains a set of three miniature gadgets. These include a cutting laser, medical flashing device, and projection lens.

## Powers / Abilities

- **Detailed Internal and External Environmental Tracking:** Chronos is an extremely sophisticated piece of technology, and is able to monitor a large number of external environmental factors, as well as monitor several internal factors about its wearer.
    - **External Factors** include: date, time, temperature, air pressure, density, and purity, radiation levels, light level, gravitational strength, humidity, and more.
    - **Internal Factors** include: Heart rate, blood pressure and contents, brain activity, body temperature, body food, water, and oxygen levels, current horizontal and vertical velocity, steps taken per day, current acceleration, gyroscopic orientation, compass orientation, and more.
- **High Durability and Longjevity:** Chronos was built with a rechargable, high-capcity graphene battery, and can run for weeks without recharging. The watch can recharge using solar power, or by using an external power source. Chronos also has a heavily reinforced case, reinforced glass, and shielding against water, dust, extreme tempertures, radiation, and EMP attacks. Its operating system was programmed from scratch, made to be as efficient and long-lasting as possible. For security's sake, the watch does not have any networking features.
- **High Resolution Projector:** Chronos can use its projector lens to display high resolution images or video. There is a small speaker inside the watch, though it is not well suited to play loud or complex sounds.
- **Medical Flashing Tool:** Chronos includes a small, Medicinal Flashing Device. By strobing a specially designed LED, the device can, with about 10 seconds of sustained use, fully heal small and medium wounds, as well as partially heal large wounds or even severed limbs. The device covers a circular area about 4 inches in diameter, and, due to extremely high power draw, can only be used continuously for about 2 minutes before needing to recharge.
- **Cutting Laser:** Chronos has a small, fairly powerful visible cutting laser. The laser is orange in color, and can easily burn less durable materials such as wood, rubber, plastic, and even softer stones. The laser is mostly used for brief self defense (Ex. shining the laser in someone's eye to blind them), or for drawing, The laser can completely cut through some materials, though doing so may take one or several minutes.

## Trivia
- Chronos was named after the Greek god of time, Khronos Aion. This is because Sammy sees Chronos as "the god of all watches".
- Chronos' metal band was originally all black, but was changed to have a back and yellow pattern to match Sammy's armor.
- Chronos can run DOOM
