## Powers / Abilities
- Blood weaver has been enhanced with several enchantments

- **Durability and Regeneration:** Blood Weaver is indestructible against non-divine materials, and extreme durability durable against divine materials. It can also regenerate damaged parts of itself, costing about 1 adult human body's worth of blood to regenerate 1 cubic inch of material.
- **Cutting Power** - Blood Weaver has a razor sharp and self-refining / repairing edge. This, combined with its extreme durability and the enhanced strength of its user means Blood Weaver can effortlessly cleave through any non-divine barrier or force. This includes physical or magical barriers, force fields, and even other self-healing materials, the latter of which Blood Weaver has a nullifying effect on.
- **Blood Magic:** Blood Weaver can absorb massive amounts of blood at a time, store a seemingly infinite amount of it, and utilize said blood to heal itself, its user, and anyone it's user wants to heal. When blood is absorbed, it appears to be sucked into the blade's edges, through the blade's veins, and into the sword's eye. In some cases, Blood Weaver's healing abilities can revive the recently deceased. 
- **False Telekinesis:** Blood Weaver can be either physically or telepathically wielded by its User. Similarly, it can be "holstered" anywhere on the User's body, where it will simply closely float next to it's holstered location.
- **Portal Opening:** Blood Weaver can be used to open or close portals with one swing of its blade. Portals can be opened absolutely anywhere, and can be used to travel through, between, or even beyond time, space, dreams, etc. This portal-opening ability can be combined with its False Telekinesis ability.
- **Summoning:** Combining its Portal Opening and False Telekinesis Abilities, Blood Weaver can be summoned at any time from anywhere by its User.
- **Weightlessness:** Though Blood Weaver weights a total of 400 lbs, it will feel weightless to its User.
- **Self Protection:** While Blood Weaver can be picked up by people other than its User, it will very rapidly drain the blood supply of said non-Users, causing intense pain and nausea, and can very quickly lead to death. This applies to both divine and non-divine entities.
    **User Enhancement:** Blood Weaver's current User will gain superhuman strength and speed, as well as limitless stamina, an extremely potent healing factor, and inability to feel pain. Similarly, Blood Weaver is constantly cycling its User's blood supply with clean, and oxygenated blood from its storage. This indirectly grants the user an extremely high alcohol tolerance, no need to breathe, and immunity to disease.
