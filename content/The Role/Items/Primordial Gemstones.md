## Overview

### Description
The Primordial Gemstones, also known as "Primes" or "orbs", are a multicolored set of crystals that can grant someone various elemental powers. Each orb is a perfect sphere, is 4 inches in diameter, and weighs exactly 5 lbs. Orbs' colors reflect the element they represent.

### Gaining Powers
Upon physical contact with a person, an orb will have an (often violent) reaction, which will typically be representative of its element. After said reaction, the orb itself will turn completely black and become extremely fragile, while the person who touched the orb (now denoted as the orb's "User" will have gained the orb's power(s). Whether or not an orb will react with a person is hard to predict, and it is thought that the orb itself actually chooses whether or not to react.

* * *

### Using Powers
Upon gaining an orb's power, a User will normally also take that orb's **Form**, which causes these effects:
    1.  The User's eye color will change to reflect the orb's color.
    2.  The User will experience a (sometimes drastic) personality shift.
An orb's powers can only be used whilst in that orb's Form. A User can shift in and out of an orb's Form at will. Shifting Forms has been described as "stretching a muscle you didn't know you had." While newer Users can only shift into / use one Form at a time, very experienced Users can use multiple Forms at once.

Combining Forms generally results in a mixing of eye color and personality shifts. It *is* possible, although rare, for two different Forms' personality shifts to cancel each other out. With enough experience, a User can completely negate any personality shifts caused by an orb's Form.

When in an orb's Form, using any of its powers will be physically exerting for the User. Using a power more intensely / for longer will cause more intense feelings of exertion. Should a User be "too tired" to use a Form's powers, they will involuntarily shift out of any presently active orb Forms, and often collapse out of exhaustion afterwards.

Orb powers are tied to a User's soul, and thus can technically persist after death, or between different physical bodies

## Lightning Orb
**Mastering Difficulty:** 6/10
**Description:** The Lighting orb has a light blue tint and is electrified in appearance. The inside appears to encapsulate a myriad of lightning bolts, arching about the orb. Contact results in the User being struck with a bolt of lightning. This will cause extreme pain (bypassing even heavy armor), but will not damage the User's body. Once struck, the User will most likely black out for a few seconds. Upon waking up, the User's eyes will have changed to a light blue color, along with their personality being drastically warped into a happier, more bubbly version of themselves. Similarly, the User will be more easily surprised or flustered, less fearful overall, and feel less pain overall. The User's reaction time will drastically shorten, and their heart rate will increase to about 115 BPM. Alongside all this, the User will gain a myriad of powers, as well as basic awareness of these powers.

### Powers & Abilities
- Ability to cast instant or continuous bolts of lightning from one's hands.
- Ability to traverse across the ground in an electrified state at around 850 miles per hour.
- Ability to transform into lightning and travel through clouds at speeds going up to, but not including, the speed of light. Faster speeds require a higher level of mastery and control of the orb's powers.
- Ability to control a single individual's limbs / body with direct contact, no matter if the individual is conscious or not. Can be used to sever specific nerve connections / paralyze a person. Can also be used as "mind control" to an extent.
- Ability to "jump-start" an individual's heart / brain if they are knocked unconscious or diseased.
- Ability to create a sphere of electricity up to 50 ft in diameter. The sphere will protect the User and strike down any and all projectiles / attacking forces within a 50 ft radius of it.

## Ice Orb
**Mastering Difficulty:** 4/10
**Description:** The ice orb is tinted a transparent white and is frosty in appearance. It appears to encapsulate a large snowstorm within itself. Contact results in the User's appendage used to touch the orb becoming overcome with a freezing pain, followed by a wave of the same pain rippling throughout their body. The User is most likely to go into shock, although the body will remain externally and internally unharmed. Post-contact, the User's eyes and hair will have changed to a snowy white color. There will also be a light layer of frost forming around the User's hands. Alongside the appearance change, the User's will become much more cold, calculating, and analytical; sometimes even harsh. Most of their emotions, including happiness, fear, anger, disgust, etc. will be either partially or fully nullified. The User's body temperature will also drop to 65°F, and the User will receive a myriad of powers / awareness of said powers.

### Powers & Abilities
- Ability to shoot fragments, mists, and torrents of ice from one's hands.
- Ability to seal wounds using ice, which melts into and seals a damages area with flesh identical to the User. Can be used to replicate any type of organic material, given a sample of said material.

Post-contact, the User's eyes will have changed to a bright red color, and they will have a body temperature increase of about 15°F. Alongside appearance changes, the User will become significantly more aggressive, irritable, reckless, and sexual.

## Healing Orb

**Mastering Difficulty:** 8/10
**Description:** The Healing Orb is colored light pink - similar to Himalayan salt - is smooth - similar to a pearl - in appearance. Touching the orb will cause the User to be momentarily engulfed in a blinding flash of pink light, and instantly healed of any and all injuries they may have. In the Healing orb's Form, a User will have soft pink eyes, and will become much more altruistic / pacifistic. Unless pushed to their absolute limit, the User will refuse to hurt or injure another person, and will prefer vegetarian or vegan food options over all others. Even when forced to fight, the User will try only to disarm or subdue foes with as little violence as possible. The User will put other people's health before their own, and will try to help anyone who needs it, including enemies they may have previously been fighting. Alongside their altruism, the User will be much more emotionally / mentally vulnerable. Words and actions will effect their psyche much more, and the User themselves will be much more open to others about their own thoughts and feelings. Not being able to help or save another person will cause the User great emotional distress.

### Powers & Abilities
- Ability to heal various injuries. The healing itself is much faster than natural healing, but isn't fast in of its own right. Minor wounds take several minutes to completely heal, and major wounds or severed limbs can take one to several hours to fully heal. A User's ability to heal another is limited by their stamina and mastery over the orb. Higher levels of mastery over the orb will allow the User to heal more, and use less stamina. The User can heal their own injuries, but will often be too busy helping / healing others to notice said injuries.
- Detailed medicinal knowledge about any person the User is helping, and higher sensitivity to injuries. A User will be able to very effectively diagnose and attempt to treat any Form of injury or sickness in another person. They will be able to detect even more subtle issues, such as an oncoming heart attack or early stage cancer. This medical knowledge / ability does not persist outside of the orb's Form.
