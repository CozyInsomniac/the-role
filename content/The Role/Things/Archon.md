# Background

Archon was founded in 1960 by Ceo David Phronox, with funding from the FBI, CIA, and NSA. In all official records, the company did not exist. It would instead operate invisibly from the shadows, and serve as a sort of ruler, or "archon" over several other "subarchs". Some subarchs were created by Archon, while other previously existing ones were simply absorbed into its rule. Notable subarchs included Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics. Archon would bring about and slowly introduce new technological advancements to the world through its subarchs. Because the initial few years of Archon's operations were overwhelmingly successful, and, most notably, profitable, the laboratory was eventually extended to include other fields of technology, and, consequently, more subarchs. Notable subarchs in this age of the lab's life were the members of FAANG (Facebook / Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet), along with other corporations, like OpenAI and NASA. Again, Archon would create the new forms of technology, and distribute it though its subarchs. Again, it was wildly successful.

While Archon was initially made as a form of concealing nation weaponry secrets through a shadow organization, its extension into other categories of technology saw it also becoming a massively successful surveillance network. Archon brought about so-called "secure" standards for communication and encryption, such as WPA2, AES, and the infamous TOR and I2P networks. Naturally, every single one of the aforementioned contained back doors.
