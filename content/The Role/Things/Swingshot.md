 Swingshot is an axe/gun/rifle hybrid made for [[Sunflight Spearwind]]. As an axe, Swingshot is extremely durable, and razor sharp, capable of effortlessly cutting through nearly any non-magical material. As a firearm, Swingshot is semi-auto, can fire both regular and dust cartridges (most calibers below .50 BMG), and has an internal magazine that can hold up to 9 rounds. It must be reloaded one round at a time. Swingshot has two enchantments applied to it:
	- 1. Swingshot will always end up near Sunflight when she goes through a portal. 
	- 2. Swingshot can shift between gun, axe, and canister forms based on temperature applied to it:
		- $\leq0 \to 189 \degree F$ \- Canister form
		- $189 \to 197 \degree F$ \- Axe form
		- $197 \to 209 \degree F$ \- Shotgun form
		- $\geq209\degree F$ \- Rifle form
- In shotgun and axe form, Swingshot's blades will stay spread outward, so as to not damage the user's hands when priming the chamber with the cocking mechanism. In sniper form, the blades fold inward to create a pseudo kickstand.
