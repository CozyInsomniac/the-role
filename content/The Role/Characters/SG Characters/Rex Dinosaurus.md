- **Background / Backstory:** Born in the Cretaceous time period due to a genetic mutation and saved by a portal just before his parents ate him, Rex grew up in a literal dump, surviving on eating trash and sometimes humans. All around the yard, he always found strange bundles of paper with odd squiggly black lines on them, otherwise known as books. Eventually, he taught himself to read and became quite the intellectual, reading books on history, science, medicine, and even fantasy. Mathematics, however, he never touched on. Now, he lives in his junkyard, sometimes hunted by animal control, but otherwise unbothered. During his time in the junkyard, he has made a few friends with employed at the dump, all whom have vowed to keep his existence a secret.
