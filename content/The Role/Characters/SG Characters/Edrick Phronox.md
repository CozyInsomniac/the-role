# Biography
Edrick's story begins with his "father" David Phronox. The man was nothing short of a genius, a prodigy, an intellectual "god among men." In his earlt life, he shortly worked for a small car production company in America, before soon starting his own business: Archon. Back then, the company started first as a strong rival to other car manufacturers. The vehicles Archon pumped out were years ahead of their time, and David knew it. It wouldn't take long for him to move on to inventing various new technologies. Radio, television, computers - they all began in the mind of David Phronox. with time, David became bored of innovating only artificial technologies. The man wanted to move on to "innovating" life itself. This would end up being his biggest mistake. 
On January first of 1957, David begin work on a new project he had never attempted before: A synthetic human being. While David had modified and messed with the biology various smaller life forms - mice, rats, even small dogs - he had never attempted such changes on a human being, nevermind creating one from scratch. The project countless weeks (and lives) to finally get right. After 56 failed attempts, David finally cracked the code, successfully creating the world's first fully synthetic human fetus. This fetus, which David named "Edrick", was designed to be the "perfect" human being. Edrick was embedded with several biological modifications, including highly accelerated physical and mental growth, a strengthened immune system, resistance to cancer, and several other nicities. 


This project would be a complete 180 from David's normal industrial work, and instead would focus on the human body and it's organic capabilities. In six hours, David grew what would be known as the world's first synthetic human fetus. While at the time, this was an incredibly exciting moment for the man, it should have served as the exact opposite, and instead a reason for fear to rise. This synthetic fetus, this test tube specimen, was Edrick. To make things worse, David had gone above and beyond in creating Edrick in an attempt to make the boy "perfect." However, this would only add his demise in the end

What was once a collection of living cells in a tube with him grow up to become a remorseless killer, and monstrous being, driven by the pursuit to make the world "perfect." This of course, is Edrick, A half-human, half synth who currently serves as the "owner and CEO" of Archon. His philosophy, which stems from his subjective idea of a "perfect" world , is that he himself is quite literally a god among men, and that he must convert humanity to a race of perfect, obedient creatures. Thus, he created synths, his species of "perfect" creatures. No longer would Edrick need to concern himself with the "corrupt fleshy meatbags" known as humans. Now, his synths would do the dirty work for him.

However, ever since Sammy stole one of his newer models and, in Edrick's words, "defiled my perfection to become his own jerry-rigged pet," he has
become nearly obsessed with capturing, containing, killing, and converting Sammy into a synth. This served as Sammy's main threat during his life in the wastelands, and still haunts him as a danger to watch out for to this day.
