# Appearance
## Human Form
In human form, Corvin has an understated “Gothic” appearance, with messy black hair falling neck-length down the back and sides of his
head, and about halfway down his face, parted in the middle. He has an intense and somewhat startling gaze, with black irises, contrasting
with his pale complexion. He has a moderately handsome face, with slightly sharp features that complement his slender build. Attached to
his back are two shiny black feathered wings with which Corvin can use to fly. Corvin typically wears a collage of black and grey, his outfit
consisting of a pair of well-worn, laced work boots, straight fit jeans that have been patched and re-patched countless times with various
materials and fabrics, a long-sleeve undershirt, a duffel coat, black, fingerless leather gloves, and a bandanna with subtle feather
decorations tied around his neck. 
## Crow Form
As a crow, Corvin is literally just a regular-looking crow. Caw caw.
