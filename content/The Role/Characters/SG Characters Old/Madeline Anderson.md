## Appearance(s)
### Human Form
- Perhaps the most unnerving part about Madeline is how normal she appears; At least, from afar. Madeline is a woman with a slim, healthy build. While her arms are slightly more muscular than the average woman of her age, and hands surprisingly delicate, she is neither particularly buff or chubby. She has waist length, chesnut brown hair, fair, slightly pale skin, and, most notibly, crimson red eyes that give off an extremely faint glow. Madeline normally wears a light black jacket over a white short-sleeved shirt, along with blue jeans, and hiking boots. Rarely is Madelin every seen without her sword, Blood Weaver. She normally carries the weapon either in hand, or "holstered" on her back. When holstered, the weapon is not actually attached to any part of Madeline, and instead simply floats very closely behind her back.

## Other

- **Personality:** Madeline's personality is extremely volatile in nature, and can shift at a moment's notice. Most of the time, however, Madeline is extremely confident, cocky, reckless, and can seem downright airheaded at times. She has a very short attention span, and tends to ramble about whatever's on her mind, regardless of whether or not people are listening. For example, both during and after fights, Madeline will often throw taunts and insults at her opponents. Madeline very rarely shows more "vulnerable" personality traits, such as sympathy, jealousy, concern, caution, and especially sadness. If she happens to grow fond of a person, Madeline will more often than not becomes obsessed with them, which ironically makes her slightly more sensitive to words, actions, wants, and needs. Madeline also has 4th wall awareness.
    
- **Vocals:** Lighthearted and upbeat sounding, but with a hint of sarcasm in every sentence. Can become frighteningly serious and stern at a moments notice, and return to lightheartedness in the very same way.
    
- **Strengths:** Madeline's sword - Blood Weaver - gives her increased strength, speed, endurance, healing ability, and stamina. Thus far, there has been no known substance that the blade cannot cut through. Emotional or psychological manipulation is near impossible with Madeline, as is any sort of fear-mongering. She has no need for sleeping or breathing, due to her sword acting as a sort of "life support" for her, constantly providing oxygenated blood and cycling it throughout her body. Because of her 4th wall awareness, she remembers the past works of fictions that she has been in, as well as the people she met in them.
    
- **Weaknesses:** Ice / extremely cold temperatures slow Madeline's healing. Also, if her blade runs out of blood, Madeline will starve to death. If Madeline is more than 6.66 meters away from her sword for over an hour, she will begin to slowly weaken. If she is away from the sword for 24 hours, she will die.
    
- **Likes:** Camels, jokes, sarcastic, clever, or dark humor, adventure, spicy foods, gemstones, geology, dinosaurs, dragons, petting animals, hunting prey
    
- **Dislikes:** Manipulation, overblown romance, the cold, isolation, vampires, holy water, garlic
    
- **Relationship(s):**
    
    - Romantic: *None*

***
- **Background / Backstory:** Madeline was born into the world on May 7, 1999 in Phoenix, Arizona. From the start, she lived without a father, the man having left his wife immediately after hearing she was pregnant, and taking a significant amount of her possessions, including her wedding ring. Unable to support herself and her daughter in the big city, Madeline's mother moved to a much smaller town, far from city life. There, they lived a nearly impoverished, but somewhat sustainable life. Madeline herself showed a fascination with geology from a very young age, and spent much of her time collecting interesting looking rocks and gemstones and bringing them back home. While they brought great joy to herself, they only made her mother increasingly bitter, the gemstones having reminded her of her previously stolen wedding ring. Regardless, she didn't wish to push that weight on her daughter, and thus kept Madeline in the dark about her parental abandonment. Madeline lived her early years fairly normally, performing above-average in elementary and middle school, and the first few years of highschool. She was originally a soft-spoken girl with a gentle personality, a great deal of compassion for those around her, and a passive, subtle, but effective sense of humor. She did suffer mild to moderate bullying in middle school, but she never let it get to her, for the most part. Furthermore, she continued to pursue her interest in geology, digging up many more interesting gemstones like amethyst, opals, erinite, and a few rarer ones like emerald, and ruby. Out of them, her favorite was the camel jasper, mostly because it reminded her of her favorite candy, caramel. While the gemstones brought in much bitterness for her mother, they also brought in money, and a lot of it. It allowed her and her mother to rise up in social classes, coming to rest in the middle class. Then, one day, Madeline found a diamond. That find was the final breaking point for her mother. Instead of the great joy she thought her mother would feel, Madeline was met with her mom breaking down in tears immediately after the stone was presented to her. Concerned, Madeline asked the age-old question of "what's wrong?" Upon hearing her mother's explanation, Madeline vowed to seek revenge; not the violent type, but a different, smarter form. She made the promise to her mother that they would become rich, far more than her neglectful father ever could be. Madeline would keep finding gemstones, keep selling them, bit by bit bringing herself and her mother more riches. The next day, she took a trip to the grand canyon - somewhere she had been multiple times before. There, she found a small cave opening she had never seen before. The opening led to a small, hollowed out "room" in the rocks. In the center of the room, a sword seemingly made of crystal was lodged in the ground. Madeline first suspected the blade to be fake, but upon further inspection, she found the blade to be made of seemingly diamond. This sword, she would later find out, was The Starved Edge. With glee, she saw this as her ticket to success, and grabbed the hilt. Her entire life came crumbling down the moment her hand touched the handle. Immediately, the blade chose her as its owner, corrupting her mind, body, and memory. Her once bright blue eyes, shimmering like aquamarines, ran crimson, becoming a dark, blood like red. Her blood was replaced with that of the blade's - an unknown type that provides greater strength, speed, swiftness, but at the cost of the final price Madeline paid: her past. She became an entirely new person, going from being a soft-spoken and gentle girl, to a borderline psychopath. Her emotions were twisted to have highly amplified positives and negatives, leading to her bipolar personality. She became numb to killing, having flashes of genocidal thought before sudden washes of guilt. Worst of all, her memories were all but wiped, leaving behind bits and pieces of what was her past. Contrary to the gemstone-loving scavenger she used to be, she is now no less than a dimension-hopping serial killer, constantly looking for "entertainment." As it stands, Madeline is a tragedy within a tragedy, and she doesn't know, or care less.
