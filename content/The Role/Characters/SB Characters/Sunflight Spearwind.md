# Biography
Having hatched with her larger twin brother Skyfall, Sunflight was quickly found out to be a Firescale by her parents. Fearing for her safety, her mother Ember defected from her military post, and fled with Sunflight so that she wouldn’t be used as a weapon. When Sunflight was 5 dragon years (10 human years) old, a rouge Icewing attacked Ember and her while they were out hunting. It was a long and difficult battle, Ember held off the Icewing for Sunflight to flee, but the false Firescale choose to stay and fight. During the fight, Ember was killed, and Sunflight earned the tri-claw mark scar running down her body, but she was able to kill the Icewing. After scattering her mother’s ashes, she tried carrying on with her life. Roughly two dragon years later, she was captured and brought to the capital. Queen Scarlet wanted to break her spirits, so she made her fight in the area. This went on for almost two months until with the aid of the other prisoners, Sunflight was able to escape, sadly the others weren’t so lucky. She fled east, encountering a portal for the first time while flying near the ocean.
