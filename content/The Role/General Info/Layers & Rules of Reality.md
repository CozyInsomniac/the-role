| 3      | The Multiverse     | Contains all non-spiritual Realities and Entities.<br>Characters from here are called "**Entities**".<br>Spaces from here are called "**Realities**".                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 4      | The Dreamverse     | Contains all dreams experienced by Characters and Divines and Entities native to those dreams (Ex. Vampires from that one dream Sun had).

| 5      | The Void           | The Void is an infinite expanse of nothing that "contains" all retconned CSEs. A CSE can only be brought into/out of the void by an Author.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Beings cannot turn themselves into Authors. Authors cannot be physically, mentally, spiritually, conceptually, or otherwise generally affected by any Character's power(s). |
| 1      | Character from Layer 2 and below are broadly known as "Entities". Universes, dimensions, worlds, and locations from Layer 2 and below are broadly known as "Realities".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2      | Characters may travel between their native and lower layers, with the exception of the Void. Characters may not travel to layers higher than their native later unless given permission / brought into said higher layer by a Character from that higher layer. Characters may only travel to the void if brought in by an author.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3      | Characters have partial or full power / control over lower layer Characters. Lower layer Characters can fight back against higher layer Character' power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
