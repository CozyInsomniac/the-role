# Part 1 (January 6,  2019 - July 26, 2020)
**SG:**
Sammy lays peacefully with the two as the sun sets over the horizon, enshrouding the desert in a blanket of darkness.

The town seems fairly modern, although surprisingly low in population. A few signs are nailed to various telephone posts and trees, all which crudely portray what seems to be a large ball of pointy and sharp objects, and the words STAY AWAY LOOK AWAY written under it.

`Context: Raven got caught in the SCP facility.`
***
**SB:**
Sunflight stretches out on top on Sammy, playfully ruffling his hair before standing up. Eclipse eventually gets up and wanders off, probably to go hunt.

Malory looks at the signs, and being rebellious, grabs Snow’s hand and races off to find the ball of spikes.
***
**SG:**
Sammy looks up with a raised eyebrow and a small smirk at the Skywing, he too also standing up and brushing some sand out of his hair.
***
**SB:**
Sunflight smiles, giving Sammy a quick kiss before scooping him up in her arms and taking flight. 

Raven sighs, seeing no way out of the cell he’s in. “What do you want to know?” 
***
**SG:**
After about 5 minuets of scouring the town for the ball, Malory and Snow come across a small mass of about 30 people, all violently attempting to break into a building. The building is heavily boarded up on all sides, with a few other people attempting to fend off the attacking pedestrians. "Stay away! They shout to Snow and Malory. "Don't become like them!"

"Well, we have a list of questions to ask you. Answer them truthfully, and all will be fine. Number one, what are you, and where did you come from?" 
***
**SB:**
“What’s in there? The last waffle or something?” Snow says, watching the crowd.

“An ‘angel’. And I don’t have an answer for the second question.” Raven responds, fairly sure he’s caught tuberculosis, as he’s isn’t vaccinated for it, and he’s developed a pretty bad cough. 
***
**SG:**
Sammy relaxes in Sunflight's arms, looking down at the sandy landscape below them. "Even though it's so barren down there, it feels... peaceful being above it all." He says quietly.

A man defending the building looks at Snow as if she were crazy. "Are you serious?! You don't know?! Inside is t-this thing, this... mass of fish hooks razors, fish line, scissors, needles, knives, saws, and all this other sharp crap! Anyone that's looked at it immediately wants to touch it and the second they do, they get entangled within the thing and bleed out!"

"I see, and how old are you?"
***
**SB:**
“Reminds me of the desert back on Pyrrha.” Sunflight adds, hugging Sammy closer as she glides in the air.

“Mal, you should probably just make a rock wall around the place.” “Already on it.” Malory replies, flicking her wrist upwards as a massive stone wall erupts from the ground, covering the door and windows.

“16.” Raven answers. 
***
**SG:**
"Well, yeah, I would assume most deserts are similar." Sammy says with a chuckle.

The wall knocks back both those defending and attacking the building. Those attacking go right back to attempting to bash the wall down, but to no success. Those defending withdraw away, thanking Malory afterwards.

"Your blood type?"
***
**SB:**
“Oh hush.” Sunflight huffs, climbing higher into the sky.

Malory and Snow walk off.

“No idea.”
***
**SG:**
"Well, I'm not wrong, no?" Sammy asks with a smirk whilst lightly poking Sunflight's nose.

A "STAY AWAY LOOK AWAY" poster blows by the two as the sounds of metal, wood, and other objects banging against stone can be heard.

"Then we will draw some blood from you. Cooperate, and you will remain unharmed. Any attempts to escape will result in immediate termination. Do you understand, SCP-5000?"
***
**SB:**
“Wouldn’t be the first time I’ve been threatened with death.” Raven mutters, annoyed. Snow and Malory hop on a bus and head to a city, and do some pastry shopping.
***
**SB:**
Sunflight continues to fly, circling a small city for a little.

Raven reluctantly lets the doctor draw blood.
***
**SG:**
Sammy watches the landscape below, his focus darting from building to building. It never ceases to amaze him how civilizations could pop up in seemingly any place at any time. "Hey Sun?" He asks, "Do you think our older selves live in only one place, or do you think they perhaps travel the portal multiverse, like us?"
***
**SB:**
“I don’t know.” The Skywing answers, swooping a bit lower to let Sammy get a better look at the city. “I guess we’ll just have to live our lives to find out.”

Raven flinches a little at the doctor’s needle, but forces himself to stay still, less he risk cutting open an artery.

# Skipping 3+ IRL years worth of plot...

Just because I like jewelry doesn’t make me an expert. But I’m sure the jeweler at Skyshard can help you with whatever material you want it to be.” Sunflight replies, brushing her wing tip to his. 
“We can rest outside the town and head inside in the morning. Tempest is an old friend of mine. He’ll be the one making the bracelets. It will take a few days to be forged, and don’t worry about the cost. I’ll be glad to cover it.” Cirrus calls, ahead of the two love birds. He soon drops back, asking if Sammy wants to take the lead for this leg of the flight, just to see what it is like.

"Sure! Why not?"
Cirrus and Sunflight drop behind Sammy. Outside of Cirrus occasionally telling him which general direction to fly in, Sammy leads the small group completely fine on his own. He subconsciously tries to fly as fast as he can, knowing his skywing companions have to hold back in order to not leave him in the dust. At this point, flying for Sammy, feels as natural as walking. Finding, riding, and adjusting to wind currents is practically second nature, and what once felt like an oversized mass of scales, wings, and tail, now actually feels like his own body. Before long, the dragons spot the distant silhouette of Skyshard.

The sun is starting to go down, Skyshard illuminated by many standing torches, cooking fires and some forges. As the trio get closer, the jagged peak of the mine is clearer. It’s easy to see how the area got it’s name. Cirrus takes the lead, asking Sammy and Sunflight if they want to land to rest before heading into the city in the morning. Overall, the older Skywing’s mood is pleasant, but there is one worry in the back of his mind; Summit, and what she would think about his daughter’s soon to be husband.

Sammy, having been somewhat guiltily peeking into Cirrus' mind, feels a small shudder go up his spine at Summit's name. Sunflight and Solarflare had told him more than enough about Cirrus' sister for him to know she'd be less than thrilled to learn about him, never mind his true identity as a scavenger. Anxieties pick at his mind as he too starts to worry about her reaction. He tells Cirrus that he'd rather land and rest, and the group does so promptly. After setting up a small camp, they converse.
"By the way," Sammy eventually says, eyeing Cirrus, "You mentioned the other day you and Sun would be willing to teach me air and spear combat. Any chance we could go over the basics before checking in for the night?"

“Absolutely. What would you like to learn?” Cirrus asks, standing from where he’d been sitting. He’d brought his spear, not expecting any trouble, but old habits were hard to break. The weapon is long, easily over 6 feet. The handle is covered in entirety with carving, most depicting battles Cirrus has fought it in, and of his basic training. But one sequence is of his relationship with Ember. The carvings are not quite hieroglyphs, but a simple rather stylized picture.
“Now. We’ll start with basic spear work. Air to air combat practice is best done when there is ample light and plenty of air between you and the ground. As I made this spear, it’ll be best suited for me. Though it should be good enough to practice with until you can make your own.” The older Spearwind starts with the bare basics, how to hold and stand with a spear to not fall over. The stance is strange to see, a dragon who typically moves on all fours standing and walking on the hind legs, tail acting as a balance and counter weight. The spear is held below the shoulder, angled out from the wings, grasped with both front claws.

Thanks to his time spent as a human, Sammy gets ahold of the stance quite quickly. While familiar, his different body weight, shape, and appendages do make it somewhat of a challenge. Impressed, Cirrus gives Sammy a few pointers on the stance, before showing him a few more, including a "ready",  "attack", and "defence" stance. Once Sammy gets the hang of them, he and Cirrus begin to go through a few basic thrusts and blocks. Like the stances, they're uncharacteristically "human" in nature: strange to see done by a dragon, but very natural feeling to a former scavenger like Sammy. Of course, Cirrus still has plenty of advice to give him, as Sammy had never really practiced non-computer-aided spear combat, even in his normal body.

They use a tree as a dummy for Sammy to get some attacking practice in. Sunflight joins in, her spear skills as a dragon slightly rusty. The spear is definitely too long for her to use correctly, but she doesn’t mind. Soon though she’s had her full of spear drills and trots around Sammy, an idea forming in her head. Why not try sparring him? She needs experience of fighting a much larger foe in this form as it has been several years since she’s had to do so. “Hey Sammy, up for a light sparring match? Dad, you’ll be the judge?” She’s seen what her husband is capable of, but she needs to experience it herself, and what better way to do that in a safe controlled environment. Ground rules are laid out, slightly stricture one than his practice against Cirrus due to the size difference.

Sammy and Sunflight prepare themselves. Sammy wields Cirrus' spear, the head temporarily removed, so as to not accidentally skewer his wife. Meanwhile, Sunflight uses a suitable, blunt banch she had found lying nearby.
Cirrus raises a claw.
"Ready... Set... Begin!"
Sammy and Sun circle one another. Sammy is still a beginner at spear combat, while Sunflight is fairly rusty, which makes for a somewhat even matchup. Sammy's eyes are laser-focused for the slightest hint of an attack. He knows better than almost anyone of his wife's speed. Playing defensive is his best bet until he can figure out a possible fake-out or counterattack. Sunflight, on the other hand is mindful of both her size disadvantage, and how much of a powerhouse Sammy is in his current body. Though these things didn't make all that much difference at spear's length, they would certainly spell trouble for her, should the combat shift to close-range.
"Remember," Cirrus calls to both the duelers, "Stabbing is 10% power and 90% precision! Even a weak stab in the right place can be lethal!"
Sammy and Sunflight trade several blows. They stab, parry, counter, and dodge whilst maintaining distance. As the fight progresses, the two become slightly more risk-taking in their attacks. As Sunflight's old experience starts to rear its head, so does Sammy's quick thinking and ability to adapt. This matchup was even more interesting than the any of the three dragons had anticipated.

The sparring match has turned more into a dance. Sunflight’s old close quarter fighting tactics and style start showing through. An aggressive and fast pace flurry of strikes, but still able to jump away from his strikes. Cirrus is judging on hits landed. Three hits and you lose. He walks around the duelers, occasionally giving pointers.

Sammy winces - much more in frustration than pain - as he feels a jab against his shoulder.
1 - 3. He had lost.
"Match point!" Cirrus calls. The two duelers lower their weapons. Sammy is visibly winded, while Sunflight, quite literally, hasn't broken a sweat.
"Good... match." He breaths, extending a claw.
"Good match." She shakes his claw, almost immediately shifting from "combat" to "wife" mode. "You okay?"
"I'm fine." He replies. "I could use a bath though."
"You two did well." Cirrus says. "There's room for improvement, but overall, not bad."
"I'm surprised I lasted that long." Sammy chuckles. "Sun's like The Flash when she wants to be."
"You're not too bad yourself." Sun chimes in. "You were pretty intimidating, even we were just sparring."

Cirrus nods in agreement, pointing the two in the direction of a river to wash off. “I’m not sure who this ‘Flash’ is, but they sound formidable. There’s a river down that way if you wish to clean up. I’ll be here catching dinner once you return.” As the couple leave, he sets about setting the spear head back in the handle.
“Sorry about the match, I probably should have gone easier on you.” Her head rubs against his shoulder, unable to reach his head without standing on her hind legs. “We can have a proper dueling match in a dream later.” The river Cirrus pointed them to is wide and lazy, the banks full of mud. She is scolding herself a bit, for going too hard during the match. Fighting with a spear is rather different than with Swingshot. Walking over to the bank, she lowers her head to drink, maybe lay in the waters to clean off with Sammy.

"Don't worry about it." Sammy replies as she drinks. "In a real fight, the enemy isn't gonna hold back. I appreciate you giving it your all. Besides, even I lost, that match taught me a lot, especially about defence. As for a dream spar, I'd be up for it."
After Sammy also takes a much needed drink from the river, he and Sunflight wash themselves off. They relax for a while, enjoying one another's company, and chatting about their plans for tomorrow. Once the two are fully clean, they head back to the campsite.

“It’s good to get practice in with a physical weapon. And in hand to hand sparring.” The talks they have are nice, mostly about what to do in Skyshard, and finalizing ideas for after their second wedding. Sunflight had been considering moving their home to a safer dimension, maybe here, to somewhere in the valleys of the Claws of Clouds mountain range. She’s torn on whether to have half dragon children, or fully dragon ones. Even if they don’t have to think about it for a few years. The smell of cooking meat snaps her out of her thoughts, as does Sammy’s head rubbing against her. Cirrus was working on roasting a boar he caught.

"Welcome back you two. Dinner's almost ready." Cirrus says, eyeing the two with a smile.
"Smells delicious. Did it put up a fight?" Asks Sammy.
"It tried." Cirrus glances back at the boar as Sunflight and Sammy sit down. "Anyways, when we enter Skyshard tomorrow, we should visit Tempest first thing. The sooner we get you two's wedding bracelets made, the better."
"Mhm." Sunflight nods.
"Sounds like a plan." Sammy agrees.
Once Cirrus finishes cooking the boar, the three dragons feast on the freshly cooked meat. All of them, especially Sammy, appreciate every last ounce. After dinner, they check in for the night. Cirrus lays by himself, and Sunflight lays with Sammy, her body comfortably nestled against his side and under his wing. Sleep comes quickly for the three dragons.

The warmth of a full meal and sleeping next to a loved one, Sunflight slept like a log. Her dreamself woke slowly. She could feel movement beneath her, unsure of what it was, only that she wasn’t on a ship. Maybe a train? Could be a car. A jolt made her head snap up, blinking in the sunlight streaming in through the windows. She was sitting up right, head having been against a window. She was indeed in a train, unsure of what kind, and she didn’t see Sammy around either the booth or car when getting up to look around. Old fashioned was a good word to describe everything. Seems like a train for the English Victorian era. Compared to that, Sunflight is wearing something more modern, far less layered fabric. A full sleeve pale blue dress that went down to her ankles. She still had her boots and her belt wrapped around her waist, nothing missing from it. Definitely a dream. Now where is Sammy? She walks around searching, though sees him nowhere. The train car she was in must be near the back of the train, as she reaches the back fairly quickly. No sign of him. She sighs starting the trek over again. Not a single person in sight. This isn’t unusual for a dream, as it’s a 50/50 chance for them to have people or no one but the dreamers. She’s hoping she isn’t alone, the eeriness of being on a train alone is enough to set her slightly on edge as is.

From the looks of it, the train is chugging across a large desert. The occasional patch of dead grass or cacti dot a vast expanse of orange and yellow rocky ground. The train tracks seem to stretch endlessly accross the arid expanse. As Sunflight makes her way towards the front of the train, she can't help but shake that feeling of unease. Something about this train felt wrong, as if wasn't supposed to be here. With every empty passenger car she passes through, a feeling of unease follows. She walks through a car, then two, then five, then ten, then twenty. A hint of confusion washes across her face. Just how long was this train? She peers out a nearby window, looking for the engine.
Nothing.
Even with her enhanced sight, she can only see more train cars stretching for miles. With a sigh, she turns around, and tries heading back to a previous car.
Nothing.
Literally, nothing.
The skywing stumbles back, nearly falling off the back of the train. All of the cars she had previously walked through had vanished.

“Oh what the fuck is this?!” She cusses to herself, gripping the seat. Now she starts running forward into the upper cars. Each time she enters one, the car behind her melts into air. Her mind races. Yes, this is a dream. Well, more accurately; a nightmare. It’s a never ending plight. All the train cars are the same few variations and she hasn’t seen a single soul, or Sammy. It might be best if she wakes up and goes back to sleep. Either she’ll enter another dream, or she’ll have a dreamless sleep. Her anxiety about this place is through the roof. The train by itself is creepy enough with no one in it. Combined with the disappearing carriages? She’s in for a rough night. Soon she sits down to rest. Running for hours with no end in sight.

An electric squealing noise makes Sunflight cringe and cover her ears.
"Ssssunflight. Please report to the front of the train!" A scratchy, sing-song voice calls out from what sounds like the train's nonexistant intercom. Before she can process what the hell just happened, her car begins to slowly melt into air. Panic filling her mind, she rushes into the next car. Almost immediately, it too begins to melt away.
"Report to the engine room!" The voice says again, more demanding this time. Sunflight makes it out of her car just in time for it too to fade away.
"Report!" The intercom voice snaps. Sunflight can barely keep up now. She uses Swingshot to smash through each train car door, the fading of each train car right on her tail.
"REPORT! REPORT! REPORT! REPORT!" The intercom is deafening. 
Sunflight can feel herself hyperventilating. Even the loads of adrenaline pumping through her veins can barely mask the pain in her overworked legs.
Then, she trips.
It all happens in a fraction of a second.
For a moment, Sunflight is airborne, tumbling to the floor. Before she touches it, however, it fades away, leaving her plummeting onto the train tracks at at least 50 miles per hour. She braces for the impact, but it never comes. Instead, a deafening roar of thunder makes her eyes snap open. Instead of skidding against the ground, she's plummeting through a thunderstorm. Sheets of rain pour down around her as bolts of lightning arc dangerously close to her. In a desperate attempt to stop the madness, she tries shifting into half form to slow her fall. The instant she does, a searing pain burns across her wings, and her vision goes white. When it clears, she's falling yet again, her wings completely fried from lighting. She barely has time to process the pain when she feels the wind knocked out of her. She crashes down hard into a dark ocean, and starts to cough and sputter as she tries all at once to ignore the pain arcing through her entire body and keep herself afloat. She desperately wants to wake up, yet it's impossible to concentrate.

Swingshot had been dropped, bobbing tantalizingly out of reach. Her limbs feel too heavy to move. The waters seems to be molasses, with how hard it is to move. Something is around her leg, and the water’s growing ever higher. No. No no no. Not again. Not again. She cries out in agony as a burning sensation over takes her lungs. She can’t hold her breath any longer, the void of air replaced by freezing water. Her system shocks into a frantic last ditch effort. It is in vain, life fading from amber eyes. Everything is still, so quiet now. 
Sunflight snaps her eyes open, talons dug into the soft grass beneath her. Talons? Grass? The comforting feeling of the earth ground her back to reality. She’s okay. She’s on Pyrrhia. And that was just a nightmare. A horrifying one, but it was just a nightmare. Sunflight exhales shakily, working her way out from Sammy’s wing to go for a quick flight to clear her head. Cirrus and Sammy were still sleeping. Good, she hadn’t woke them.

The warm night air is pleasant on her scales. Even with the faint moonlight, Sunflight still needs to pay extra attention to looking where she's going. She circles around the camp for a while, trying to empty her memory of her recent dream that so elegantly blended almost everything she hated.
'At least that monster wasn't there.' She thinks. Even the faintest mental image of her vampiric tormentor sends shivers down her spine. Oh, what she'd give to be rid of him forever.
Sighing, Sunflight gently tilts left, starting yet another circle around the camp in a nearly silent glide. She glances around, eyes scanning over the landscape - the silhouette of Skyshard, the trees, and mountains. At night, they all seemed to blend into one, dark mass. Even other dragons, especially nightwings, were often easy to miss. That said, outside of her group, Sunflight hadn't seen a single other dragon tonight, not that she had expected it. This wasn't nightwing territory, after all. Though, it would have been nice to have someone to talk to.
A silhouette zips past the corner of Sunflight's vision. She quickly turns to look up at it, but sees nothing.
At first.
She suddenly spots a hint of motion in the sky, and squints to see a far-away, dragon-shaped silouette silently darting through the air. She can't tell what tribe it is, but she immediately realizes one thing:
No dragon on Pyrrhia should be able to fly that fast.

“What in the moons?” Sunflight asks herself, trying to make out the basic silhouette of the dragon to try to guess what tribe it could be. She could fly after it on her own, or circle back to wake Sammy to have some backup. She is a bit rusty as fighting while in her dragon form. Settling on waking Sammy, Sunflight lands, prodding his shoulder until he stirs. His grogginess isn’t something she’s used to, wasting a few minutes for him to get up and get his bearings. “I saw something, looked like a dragon, moving too fast for it. I couldn’t get a very good look, and figured you’d want to come. Plus it’d be nice having back up.”

Sammy glares at Sunflight in a mix of irritation and confusion. His voice is much more gravelly than normal.
"Ok, Sun, lemmie get this straight: You saw a dragon fly kinda fast, and it scared you enough to come wake me up?"
"Sammy, you have to believe me. I swear-"
"I believe you. I just don't care. It's a dragon thing flying fast. So what?"
Sunflight pauses in slight shock. Sammy was never this bluntly rude.
"It could be a threat. What if-"
"A threat?" Sammy doesn't sound even slightly convinced.
"Y-yeah! What if it's some super-strong dragon, or-?"
"Three of us, one of him. Easy."
"What about an attacking animus, or a Synthflight?"
"We'd be dead already."
"But-"
"Sunflight." Sammy interrupts. "It's nothing. Go back to bed."
Sunflight opens her mouth to speak. Nothing.
Sammy starts to walk away.
"Please." Her voice is a whisper.
Sammy pauses.
"Please just... come with me. Just this once."
Silence.
A long sigh.
A grumble.
"...Fine."

The flight is quiet for the first few minutes. Much to Sunflight's surprise, Sammy is first to break the silence.
"Hey," His voice and tone are much less harsh now. "I'm... sorry for being so nasty back there. I had just woken up, I was all groggy, I don't have my emotional inhibitor anymore, and-"
"It's fine." Sunflight replies quickly. "Let's just find this thing."
"Right... right."
The two continue their search.

During the course of the flight Sunflight is very anxious, mind flittering about with what ifs and fears of Pyrrhian’s coming across modern technology or the moons forbid, gunpowder. And her mind is picking over the nightmare, and the trauma associated with it. It’s enough fear and stress for any dragon to pick up on, much less for her husband who can currently read minds. 
A gentle tap on the wing snaps her out of a spiraling train of thought of what may happen if the humans on Pyrrhia figure out gunpowder. 
“Sun, I know you’re scared about what it could be, but you said it looked like a dragon, right?” 
Sunflight quietly cusses at herself, having forgotten Sammy can read minds. 
“Sorry, had a nasty nightmare and this sighting isn’t helping things.” The flight is uneventful for a time, but then a glint catches Sunflight’s attention, and she slows to a hover, squinting at the thing at the edge of her field of view. 
“Wait.. why is it getting bigger?” The two barely have time to comprehend let alone react to the thing hurtling past, leaving strong turbulence in its wake. Whatever the hell it is, it’s dragon shaped, but it doesn’t move quite like one. Too stiff. And what brief glimpse they got, it was metallic. Nothing either dragons nor scavengers could make, let alone dream of.

Both Sammy and Sunflight are taken aback by the thing's sudden flyby, Sammy especially. He whips around to watch the object, eyes widening as his night vision gives him a perfect crystal clear view of it.
"There's no way..." He gapes. "How the hell did-" The hybrid suddenly takes off, catching even Sunflight off guard. It takes a decent effort for her to catch up to Sammy, who shows no sign of slowing.
"Sammy, what is it?" She half yells to no response. Sammy only beats his wings harder. He seems uncharacteristically motivated - desperate even - to catch the flying metal "dragon." It doesn't take long for him to get to it, or, more accurately, it to get to him. The thing sharply banks left, wings spread wide and tail fully extended back as it turns towards Sammy and Sunflight. It comes at them like a speeding bullet. As the two start to dive out of the way in a panic, it suddenly flips its wings back, using them as pseudo-parachutes to slow its approach. It slows to a clean stop in front of Sammy and Sunflight, and starts to hover. It's wings start to flap, though they clearly aren't propelling it. Up close, Sammy and Sunflight can get a close look at the odd "dragon." While it's body is certainly dragon-like, it doesn't resemble any recognizable dragon type or tribe. If anything, it seems like a mishmash of a bunch of "dragony" traits all haphazardly thrown together. Its skin and scales are a mix of riveted metal plates varying in size, shape, and quality intermingling with what looks like skywing flesh and scales. It's unblinking eyes, both illuminated with a soft glow, are most striking. One of them has no iris, and is colored a deep oceanic blue. The other is a near perfect replika of one of Sunflight's eyes.
The three stare at one another, the metal dragon neutral, and the latter two with mixes of shock, fear, and confusion on their faces. Sammy is first to break the silence.
"Sata?" He asks, in English this time.
"Yes." Croaks a slightly distorted version of Sunflight's voice from within the metal "dragon". "It is good to see both of you."

“What in the moons?!” Her heart hammers in her chest, wingbeats uneven like her breathing as it speeds up. She can’t comprehend what is hovering in front of her. Honestly she doesn’t want to. Eyes blown wide, the world is starting to fade out for the Skywing. The voice alone is enough to creep her out, but all of this? The patchwork parts of metal and flesh is sending her mind spiraling. She’s is vaguely aware of Sammy’s voice, but the words are a blur, lost to a maelstrom of overwhelming panic.
It happens quickly, just as Sammy is able to process that Sata has found them, Sunflight goes slack and is plummeting from the sky. Her wings are limp, doing little to slow her from the oncoming ground. Shouting does nothing to wake his wife. He dives to catch her, Sata following after, but the synth in this dragon body has no real way to catch her unlike his maker. 
It’s close. Too close Sammy’s liking, but he is able to catch Sunflight before she collides with enough room to spare for a very hasty landing.

"Ugh, geeze." Sammy pants, setting Sunflight on the ground, "I swear, I can never catch a break." As the adrenaline of the situation wears off, he angrily turns to Sata. "You're gonna hide yourself, rip off all that hideous dragon crap, make yourself look normal again, and make a covering for your face. Now."
The request was ridiculous, even Sammy knew that. Sata had spent at least two weeks of nonstop labor on his dragon form, most likely hand built all the custom components, probably had to rewrite some of his own code to interface with the parts, all just to be able to make sure Sammy was safe, and this was the thanks he got?
Any rational person would be furious.
Person.
"Ok." Sata's voice scratches back monotonously. Without another word, the synth-dragon-hybrid thing ducks away into a covering. The sounds of tearing metal and flesh soon follow.
"Ugh." Sammy groans to himself, rubbing his face with a claw. "I gotta program social awareness into that idiot. Hmm, and maybe fashion sense too."

Sunflight soon comes too, talons digging into the soft ground. With a shuddering breath she opens her eyes and stands. Images of what Sata turned himself into burned into her mind. She hadn’t meant to faint, hell she wasn’t sure she could, this was the first time it had happened as far as she can remember. Finally, she lifts her head and stands, eyes opening.

“Hey Sun, Sata won’t be looking like that anymore. Are you alright?” Sammy’s voice was a great reassurance to her.

“Good. I’m okay. That form was.. disturbing, wrong, to me at least. I can’t blame him for taking that form, but I don’t think I could have looked at it for long, or explain it to my dad, and well, anyone.” She sighs, shaking her head. Her gaze shifts to Sata as he walks out from behind the rocks he had been behind “changing”. No longer in that dragon monstrosity. His current form is still unnerving, but less so.

Sammy sighs as he eyes Sata. The synth is back in "human" form, but is still an eyesore. His "clothes" consist of hastily made plate armor fashioned with materials from his dragon form. His head is uncovered, his eyes the same as before, and hair all but gone. A patched, but still visible crack runs vertically down his face.
"I guess that'll do for new." Sammy remarks. "What about the rest of the material? What'd you do with it?"
Sata rapidly starts signing with his hands.
"Woah, woah- stop!" Sammy Interrupts. "What's all that for? Just speak!"
"Apologies." Sammy cringes at the distorted Sunflight voice. "Sunflight found my past voice jarring."
"Oh... right. Well, I don't speak sign language, at least not in this form. You can talk around Sun and I, but just keep quiet around anyone else. Got it?"
Sata gives a jerky nod.
"Great." Sammy turns to Sun. "You wanna take him with us? We can tell Cirrus that he's a friendly scavenger or something."

Sata’s human form was at least something she found recognize. Even if it is still unnerving. Swallowing that, she sighs. 
“My dad isn’t an idiot, he’ll know something is up with Sata, especially with his movement. I’m still scared of how he’ll react to your human form let alone the state Sata is in. I know we can’t hide him forever, or leave him somewhere. I don’t want to overwhelm my dad, and I don’t want him to lose our trust.” This had been gnawing at her for a while, the anxiety of not knowing and the damn near paralyzing fear that came with it. It was easy to brush aside while Sammy in his dragon form, but now that Sata was here, she’s torn. She knows full well her father’s views on the humans of Pyrrhia. The scar on his shoulder is an ever present reminder. Showing him Sata might break him. But they can’t hide him forever. Ripping off the bandaid now while they could explain things might work, but the fear of disapproval and being shunned weighed heavy in her mind. She’s stopped trying to hide her mind. Guilt seeped in, as Sammy had to be reading all of this. It isn’t his fault or problem to fix.
“I don’t know how to tell him. I can punch a king in the face yet I can find it in myself to tell my own father what I’ve been doing all this time. He has a right to know but I’m terrified of how he will react to this news. It’d be rude of me to get you to tell him.”

Sammy's gaze shifts between Sunflight and Sata. Mentation is written across his face, blanketed in silence. "I'll have Sata patch himself up - for real, this time." He finally says. "He'll keep himself hidden for... long enough, and whenever he and Cirrus cross paths, it should go smoother. As for my human form, I still have no clue how to shift to it, so we don't have to worry about that. Truth be told I'd rather show Cirrus myself first and Sata some other time. You know how Sata can be."
Sunflight is quiet, considering Sammy's words.
"How long would it take for Sata to fix himself?"
Sammy turns to Sata. 
"Well?"
"Approximately two days." Sata scratches out.
"And can you keep yourself hidden for that long?"
"Most likely."
Sammy faces Sunflight.
"Sounds like a plan. Sound good, Sun?"
"What about leaving Sata alone?"
"He's been... staying alive so far. He'll be fine."
"And if my dad finds Sata before he's done fixing himself?"
"...We'll cross that bridge when- if we get there."

Sunflight takes a deep breath, nodding. 
“Okay. We’ll tell him in the morning. Hiding it any longer won’t end well if he either finds out or a curious dragon finds Sata first.” She turns to Sata, “Avoid any dragons in the area other than us, and any local humans. We’ll come find you when you are fixed.”
Getting some rest was a good idea. It would be a busy day, and they had a long conversation ahead with her dad. 
“I’ll think of how to tell him on the way back. You shouldn’t have to be the one to do it.” Sunflight starts to walk back towards their camp, dimly lit by glowing embers of their fire. Why is she so intimidated by this? Why does the thought of telling her own father the truth about her life scare her more than going into a fight?
