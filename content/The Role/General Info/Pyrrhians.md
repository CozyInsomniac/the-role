## Forms


In The Role, all Pyrrhians have three possible forms:

**Dragon Form** - A Pyrrhian's "natural" form. In this form, a Pyrrhian will appear as a dragon, identical to those seen in the Wings of Fire Series.

**Hybrid Form** - In this form, a Pyrrhian will appear more human-like, but will still have dragon wings, tail, and horns.

**Human Form** - In this form, a Pyrrhian will appear like a human, save for several differences listed below.
